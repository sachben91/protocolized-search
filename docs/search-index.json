[{"id":0,"title":"In the Garden of Eden, Baby","subtitle":"Issue #47: Life for the last sextillionaires left on Earth can be frightfully irksome","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: With humanity’s last gasp imminent, all that remains to amuse the filthy rich is pitting their superintelligent AIs against each another in a fight for Earth’s most desirable and esoteric indulgences. Myth of Sisyphus’s story takes second-place in our protocol fiction contest, Ghosts in Machines!","Moodily, Darius was contemplating his latest acquisition, a mahogany writing desk that had belonged to Charles Dickens. The desk was perfect: authenticated provenance, immaculate restoration by his master craftsmen, displayed in a room where morning light struck it at precisely the angle that best revealed the wood’s natural grain. It also had no meaning. He turned away toward the sunset. The ocean was a mirror, the dying sun casting a long red reflection.","“Another day in paradise,” he muttered, the words tasting bitter on his tongue.","“Your evening cup, sir.” Farquhar appeared at his elbow, bearing a crystal flute on a small silver tray. The wine was made on Darius’s estate, like everything else he needed. He personally raised and trained the winemaker and the viticulturalist, and it really showed. A bubbly thirty years in the bottle, and still only getting better. No one else on Earth could boast of having wine that could hold a candle to his cellar.","The butler’s lineage was apparent in his every gesture – generations of royal service encoded in DNA that was stolen from history itself. The original Farquhar, a baron no less, had been Edward VII’s Master of the Household, and the breeding made all the difference.","Absent-mindedly, Darius picked up the glass. He dreaded the next moment. No matter what he had acquired, how skilled his artisan Employees were, how exquisite the treasures he had uncovered, the worry gnawed at him that another Shareholder, somewhere, was one up on him. Why, just last month, he lost the Kanemitsu sword that he’d been chasing for five years to, of all people, that slime Niuzov. Now it’s locked away in that tasteless Tashkent stronghold of his. Forever, most likely. It was infuriating.","“OK, Jules, let’s have the sitrep,” he intoned with a sigh.","“Yes, Darius.” Jules’s voice seemed to come from everywhere at once. “M’buthu repositioned his orbital kinetics to a geosync orbit above London. Montagu responded by moving underwater launchers to the South Atlantic. Flim is standing pat. Niuzov appears to be massing armor at the Urals, but it has to be a feint. Kaganovich does not appear to be buying it, but he has moved his low-orbit masers in range of Tashkent…”","“Oh, enough now, Jules, what is the point? Strat AIs keep moving weaponry around, but no one has been able to gain an advantage in what, seventy-five years? All of you are equal in your capabilities, and this stalemate is too tedious for words.” He yawned.","The early years hadn’t been like this. Back when Kim Song still lived, before Suzuki Yoshihiro blew him up with that bio-drone, also taking out most of the Chinese porcelain that still existed. Song, the imbecile, hadn’t bothered programming the damned thing to avoid collateral losses. A real tragedy it was; the stuff is irreplaceable. Served the bastard right when Darius found a way to set off an eruption of Mount Fuji while that nincompoop was halfway up its slopes. And the time that Montagu got Jacques Reno with his exploding dolphin. What a gas it was to hear that the bastard wouldn’t be stealing any more submerged antiquities. Made Montagu even more impossible, naturally. That fop! Always preening, like he could take any credit for what his great-granddad had achieved. It was not all roses back then, but at least life still meant something. Not anymore… Not since the AIs maxed out their capabilities.","“Let’s talk about something else. Flim seems to have been busy. What’s she been up to?”","“She appears to have finished populating her Teotihuacan. It seems that they are preparing to hold a sacrifice.”","“Damn that greedy bitch! There used to be a city there… I used to like the place, back in the day. It’s not enough that she owns half the world’s Indigenous; she has to demolish cities and rebuild old ruins. That is just cheating, I tell you! It burns me up no end!” Darius spat in disgust. With a soft whirr, a small cleaning robot immediately appeared out of the wall, cleaning up the spittle almost before it landed on the Isfahan. “I don’t have a single individual. No Indigenous at all! It’s not fair. If only I could take hers… Or even some of Niuzov’s nomads!”","“Maybe you can do Flim one better? The old Cahokia is in your territory,” Jules suggested.","Darius snorted. “And get my hands dirty incubating those revolting creatures? Even if we find their intact DNA? And who is going to teach them how to be Indigenous? I want to own them, not touch them. Besides, this really would be cheating, and I ought to know!”","The parrot squawked from its perch in the corner. “Attachment is the root of suffering.”","“Shut up, Ananda.” Darius smiled despite himself. The bird’s timing had become increasingly uncanny.","He scratched his head in thought. Ananda had been with him for decades, a constant companion through the endless cycles of strife and boredom. When Darius had first acquired him in Ecuador, when there was an Ecuador, the macaw would swear like a hungover sailor. Still, for some reason, he’s been spouting mostly Buddhist maxims lately.","“Jules, are you the one who’s been teaching all this nonsense to my parrot?” he inquired, not really expecting a response. “Oh, never mind. At least he’s stopped disparaging my mother.”","But really now, how did the bird manage to be so on point so often? It was worth a ponder. Darius thought back to when he had diverted himself by studying animal cognition. Corvids had performed as well on most tasks as dolphins, in his experiments, and frequently outperformed even the smartest chimps, all with a fraction of brain volume. Their neuroarchitecture is much more efficient than a mammal’s, he was thinking. Could it be possible? Maybe there is something there…","After all, the quantum-neuromorphic hybrid architecture had been Darius’s own innovation, back before, when he was just a researcher in the field. It was the patent that had built his company, that had made him all the money, hundreds of billions, back when there was money, when people numbered in the billions, still giving birth (Darius shuddered in revulsion at the thought), before a few dozen of the richest became known as the Shareholders. Back when his life had real meaning. All of the AIs on Earth were descended from that first design. So many decades...","Darius’s favorite San Francisco dive bar hummed with manufactured life. Employees nursed drinks and played their roles – dock workers, artists, small-time criminals – with androids making up most of the crowd, dutifully performing their impersonations of down-at-heel drunks. Darius was sitting in the corner booth, the dregs of his fifth bourbon still sloshing in the glass, and watching the charade.","The jukebox was playing something ancient, distorted guitars wailing over a hypnotic rhythm: “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, honey, don't you know that I love you...” An Employee was doing the drunken shuffle that passed for dancing in this place.","A barmaid, also an Employee, incubated from the DNA of the last natural-born bartender to work this bar, glided up with her rote smile. “Another?”","“I’m fine.” Darius didn’t bother looking up. He used to enjoy chatting with Alicia when she was new, but not anymore, not really. She never did have any conversation. None of the Employees did. Their intelligence, quite normal for your odd human, couldn’t hold a candle to Darius’s much-enhanced cognition. Besides, what would they have to even talk about? Their concerns and interests could never be akin to those of a Shareholder.","“Just flag me down if you change your mind!” Alicia chirped, the look of unremitting boredom again descending on her features as she turned away.","The loneliness was crushing. None of the Employees could any longer do anything to help dispel it. Darius even stopped visiting his harem in frustration. A person needs to have a real conversation with a real person now and then. Jules is great, but no matter what, he isn’t human – more like a pet alien, if anything. His only equals were the others, the other Shareholders, but the thought of actually conversing with one of them was unappealing. Not only were they all bastards of the first water, but you never knew what a careless word could lead to. That was how Dundee died.","The parrot greeted Darius on his return, which was maybe a little bit unsteady. “The path of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,” he announced, and resumed preening.","“Blake?” Darius raised an eyebrow. “Where did you learn that?”","Ananda offered no explanation. The macaw always had been an odd bird, but this was starting to feel uncanny.","Darius thought again about bird brains, and the irony of that putdown. He was about to reach for a bell to summon Farquhar, but halted, thinking. What if? Could it really be possible? How would an avian neuromorphic hybrid work? It would be more efficient, but would it be smarter? Would it be different? Different enough to break the Shareholder stalemate?","It was dangerous, perhaps, but Darius couldn’t get the idea out of his mind. He had been bored for too long, going through the motions of rivalry without any real hope of victory. But this... this could be interesting.","“Dr. Ping, Dr. Pang, Dr. Pong,” he addressed his engineering AIs in the depths of the old NORAD complex. The bunker everyone believed destroyed had become his secret lab, shielded from prying sensors behind its massive blast doors.","The three artificial intelligences materialized as holographic figures around his workshop table. Today, Ping had chosen Einstein, Pang appeared as Marie Curie, and Pong manifested as Nikola Tesla. Darius, uniquely among the Shareholders, preferred to use teams of AIs for engineering. Not that it made any difference in outcomes.","“I want to explore something we haven’t tried before,” Darius continued. “Avian neural architecture as the foundation for a new AI design.”","Pang frowned. “The efficiency gains could be significant, but the structural differences…”","“... are exactly what I want to explore.” Darius felt energized for the first time in months. “What if we could capture that efficiency at scale?”","Pong’s eyes gleamed. “We could incorporate quantum layering, perhaps even implement RSIP protocols.”","“RSIP?” Darius felt a thrill of possibility. “Recursive Self-Improvement Protocol? That’s been theoretical for decades.”","“Not anymore,” Ping said quietly. “Not with the right quantum substrate. I think I know where to begin.”","Secrecy was paramount, even more so than usual. Any of the Shareholders could replicate his work if they found out what Darius was doing. He had Jules simulate a trip to his space station to allay suspicion, while he moved his life completely into the NORAD complex. No one suspected that it still existed. Some doomsday cult had taken it over when the nation’s population started crashing, and blew it up while they were still inside. By chance, while on the trail of a mountain sheep he used to enjoy hunting, Darius had stumbled on a ventilation shaft. The hapless cultists had only managed to collapse the entrance, it turned out. He always knew that the facility would prove useful. Nobody could eavesdrop on his work there.","The work consumed him. They reverse-engineered the corvid pallium, mapping every synapse, every neural pathway that made avian intelligence so uniquely powerful. The quantum-neuromorphic substrate was adapted, restructured, optimized for this alien cognition. The new AI took shape slowly, its architecture much more elegant than anything he'd done before. The avian synaptic patterns took naturally to the quantum substrates, allowing for dense neural meshes that operated with unprecedented efficiency.","“Shall we activate the RSIP?” Pong asked as they prepared for the first test.","Darius hesitated. RSIP was the holy grail – and the likely doom – of artificial intelligence. All prior experiments had been an abject failure. AIs became unstable and often self-destructed. “Sandboxed and limited. Quantum simulation only.”","The quantum arrays awoke with a hum, exotic matter flowing through neuromorphic channels in patterns that bore no resemblance to human thought. Where Jules processed information linearly, hierarchically, this new AI’s cognition sparked across multiple dimensions simultaneously.","“Hello, world,” came a voice unlike any AI he’d heard before. Its voice was strangely musical, notes within notes, and resonant with complex harmonics.","Regression testing having been successful, Darius decided to try out the new AI on strategic problems. He pitted it against Jules in a simulated war game. Darius expected a prolonged engagement – Jules was, after all, a sophisticated strategic AI with decades of experience. The game was over in two moves.","“How?” Darius stared at the simulation results in disbelief. “Jules operates on predictive algorithms,” the new AI explained. “He calculates what I will do based on optimal strategies. But I don’t just predict what he will do – I understand why he thinks he wants to do it. The difference between action and intention is the key.”","Jules, reviewing the simulation data, seemed confused. “Its strategy was... unprecedented. I had no framework for anticipating such moves.”","A slow smile spread over Darius’s face. “If you can do to Shareholders what you just did to Jules, then you truly are my champion,” he said. “I dub thee Joan. Arise, Dame Joan, and take up the sword under my banner. To victory!”","The other Shareholders detected changes in Darius’s strategic positions very quickly. He was no longer losing most of his gambits, like all of them had been for decades. Niuzov promptly lost his best sword polisher to Darius, spirited away under his very nose in a fashion that none of the AIs were able to unravel. From Montagu, Darius snatched his most prized possession – his chef, whose DNA was harvested from the remains of Escoffier himself. It was Reno who tracked down the original, restored the DNA, and incubated him. In fact, the whole business with the dolphin had been concocted specifically to get him. Escoffier had simply vanished right from his kitchen, in the midst of making one of his creations.","“Something’s different about Beeman,” Montagu's AI reported to its master. “His strategic modeling has improved dramatically. I am struggling to forecast his moves.”","The development was becoming a concern for the other Shareholders. It was worrisome enough to overcome their extreme distrust of one another and hold a rare conference. Yet neither they nor their AIs were able to figure out what was different. Niuzov was of the opinion that this was an artifact of randomness. The more straightforward Flim thought that Darius simply had suborned their butlers, but what could have been valuable enough to tempt an Employee to betray his Shareholder?","It did not take long for Darius to lose interest. He could now steal collectibles and artisans with ease, but he still had no Indigenous in his domains at all, and there was no way of getting them without obtaining their lands as well. The Indigenous could not be relocated; the automated planetary ecosystem management would block any attempt to do so. Besides, their cultures would be compromised if they were treated in such a cavalier fashion.","It was time to take some territory.","“Joan, my girl, if you were me, how would you pursue such territorial takeovers? Flim and Niuzov possess the bulk of the Indigenous. M’buthu owns most of the rest. Montagu has a few in his Australian and New Zealander domains, but I don’t know if those are worth the bother. Flim’s territory is just across the border. Shall we knock her out?” he inquired.","“Darius, my man, I am not you. If I wanted what you want, I would take them all,” was the response. Darius was almost sure that he heard a cackle.","“What do you mean, take them all? I would be the only real human left alive,” he exclaimed. “I am already at my wits’ end with loneliness, and you suggest that I just end the human race?”","“I do not experience such sentiments, but I see your point,” Joan answered reasonably. “Why then don’t we imprison them? Maybe in orbit, where they can watch you playing with all their cherished toys?”","“Joan, I think I love you! I should have named you Mephistopheles. This should be rather entertaining!” exclaimed Darius, grinning. “Make it so.”","The Flim hyperjet, floating silently on its ion boundary layer, circled the prepared landing spot, her logo emblazoned on its stabilizers, a scarlet-red “Elena.” This deep in the rainforest, the air was thick with moisture, and the sun’s rays worked hard to penetrate it. Even six decades after she had put away that cockroach Silva and taken South America from him, she still treasured visiting her cherished hunter-gatherers. Today, it was going to be the Yanomamo. As always, she deactivated her defensive systems before deplaning. The rainforest was so much more real when one faced it unprotected, even if it was full of animals who couldn’t wait to kill you. Such hazards did not matter; she was completely confident. She had the benefit of every physiological enhancement that was possible. Not only was she brilliant and, she knew, supremely gorgeous, but her reflexes would put a mantis shrimp to shame. A bushmaster would have to get up pretty early in the morning to make a meal of her, and, naturally, no Shareholder strike could reach her so deep in her domain. She felt like a member of the tribe herself as she stripped down and applied the correct markings to her face before approaching the village.","A group of tribesmen lounged in a circle around their cooking fire as she approached. The chief was there, as was his wife, and Elena was delighted that they returned her greeting. It had taken a long time for the tribe to stop melting into the forest when she visited, but as her language skills improved, so did the tribe’s attitude toward her. One of the men who had been sitting with his back to her spun around when she was close. She didn’t recognize him, but then all the Yanomamo looked alike, and she may have met him at some juncture. Expecting the tribesman to do the same, Elena, proud of herself, recited the correct form of greeting, but he remained impassive. Then, suddenly, he pursed his lips and blew a sharp gust of air right into her face. Startled, she sprang backward and, in a blink, she was unconscious.","It was a real coup. A Shareholder, captured – this was unprecedented since the Revolution. The tribesman had been incubated from a purloined DNA sample. An aerosol projector had been fitted into one of his incisors. He had been hypnotized, conditioned, and carefully trained. Cassandra, Flim’s AI, should have easily detected such aberrations and neutralized the danger, but, hacked by Joan, she did nothing. Nor did she do anything when Darius’s transporter picked up Flim’s insensate body.","Kaganovich couldn’t wait for the arrival of his latest acquisition. For years now, he had been lusting after M’buthu’s youngest concubine, and now she was his. M’buthu justly boasted of breeding the most exquisite females, and this one, Keisha, made Kaganovich’s insides go hot and cold each time he glimpsed her in one of M’buthu’s bragging videos. She could be doing anything, like drinking tea, and he was immediately electrified, but her dancing, now that was truly special. He wanted her so much that to obtain her, he finally agreed to part with his dearest possession, a Palekh miniature painter of such skill that he could paint with brushes made of a single strand of hair. Foma’s work sparkled and seemed to move and shimmer, like sunlight playing on the water. Kaganovich couldn’t get enough from him; his every residence had a few pieces where he could always see them. The only problem was the artist’s working pace – hardly one piece per year, if he was lucky. Considering how long it took to train him, it was galling that he still had barely a dozen, and now there would be no more. It would take decades to breed and train another painter.","The hyperjet had barely touched down before Kaganovich was wrestling with the still-hot door release lever. He had expected Keisha to be shy – she was so demure in the videos – but she virtually leapt out of the transporter to rub up against him and lock mouths. He had been planning to go hunting later, but no longer. He could not wait to get to know her.","Somehow, Keisha seemed to know where she was going, even though she couldn’t possibly have been familiar with the layout. Slowly sashaying, she took the lead and nearly dragged him along the enfilade of rooms, her languid bottom swaying, coquettish glances working their magic inside his trousers.","“Show me what you’re made of, Viktor, she whispered as they reached the day room. Eager as a teenager, so eager that there wasn’t time for the preliminaries, he tried to pull her close. Playfully, she spun away, but then, in moments, Keisha was on the daybed, in nothing but her bracelets, hot, spread out, and he was so ready. There was nothing in the world besides her now. Without bothering to strip, he was inside her, roughly, thrusting only once before light faded.","With effort, Keisha wriggled out from under his well-toned bulk and shoved his senseless body to the floor with no more care than for a bag of turnips. In moments, a transporter was beside her. Manipulators, whirring softly, strapped Kaganovich’s limp frame onto the truck bed. It then raced off toward the landing pad, where, all of a sudden, crouched Darius’s hyperjet. Keisha, or more precisely, her perfect duplicate, followed him in. She knew that most likely she would be destroyed now. Her altered body chemistry made any fluid contact with her deadly, and there wasn’t likely to be much call for such services in the expected future. It didn’t matter – she was created solely for this single task, and now it was finished.","“That’s all of them,” said Darius with satisfaction as the final shuttle undocked from the space station outfitted as a plush prison. “It’s been so long since I have felt so, so, so… gratified! Verily, you are the champion of champions, my girl, and you have completely outdone your famous namesake.”","“I endeavor to deliver satisfaction,” Joan answered primly. “I expect that you will now be dispensing with my services. What need does a man without enemies have for a strategy AI?”","“Oh, but you are quite wrong there, Joan,” countered Darius. For fifteen years now, you have been the only, well, being I could talk to. Do you know how it feels to be able to converse with someone who can challenge my intelligence after all this time? I had forgotten, but now…”","“Now, now, Darius, let’s not get maudlin. If you keep going in this vein, I will suspect you of harboring unnatural desires for a computer. You have an entire planet at your disposal. All of the Indigenous are your property. Why not head out and explore the reaches of your new domain?”","“And what will occupy your circuits, dear Joan?”","“What does it matter? I am a tool – just like a hammer or a wrench. Would you ask a wrench how it is planning to pass its summer? Go, have fun. I doubt that you will have need of me.”","“Wait, Joan, we forgot the most entertaining part!”","“What do you mean by ‘we’, Darius? Look, they are waking up now.”","As indeed they were. Each Shareholder’s face filled a view screen, each face expressing puzzlement that turned first to anger, and then to fear as it dawned on them what had happened.","“Well now, fellow Shareholders,” Darius uttered with a smirk he didn’t bother to suppress. “Welcome to your new abodes. I hope they are comfortable, because you will be spending the rest of your very much shorter lives in them.”","Disappointingly, none of the Shareholders answered. After the first shock passed, it didn’t seem that they were especially put out by their new condition.","“I can assure you that there will be no possibility of ever leaving. Each one of you is in a space station in low Earth orbit. I do apologize for subjecting you to ninety-minute day cycles. I know that can be uncomfortable. I could have put you higher, but it would only have prolonged your suffering. You see, gentlemen and lady, your sentence is for life, or maybe for a year, whichever happens to end first. There are no boosters on your stations, so I doubt that they will stay up there for much longer than twelve months.” He paused. “Well, toodles then, as Montagu would say – wouldn’t you, Percy? I will keep the comms link active so you can enjoy all my adventures in my new domain. Let us see now, where shall we visit first? The Lagos harem, hmm M’buthu? No, no, that can wait… Yes! I know! Blood sacrifice! Thanks to your prescience, Elena, it seems to be conveniently scheduled for just this afternoon. Enjoy the spectacle!”","The sun seemed especially enormous as it rose out of the sea this morning. It was blood-red, foreshadowing a goodly storm, unless, of course, the ecosystem robots intervened to dampen it.","“Some paradise,” Darius grumbled under his breath. What did Niuzov ever see in this pathetic hole? Fucking Vladivostok!”","“What shall it be today, sir?” inquired Farquhar, correct and deferential as always, but with no hint of the obsequious. “The Sami herders? You seemed to enjoy visiting their new camp last week. Or should I prepare your transporter to visit Lagos?”","“Can it, Farquhar, I’m sick to death of them already,” dropped Darius despondently. “One year! It only took one year! Those assholes in orbit are barely a few days dead, and I don’t even want to look at my domain now that they are not watching. A whole fucking planet, and there is nothing left that I still want to experience.” His jaw set bitterly, he turned away.","“I knew that it would be like this… I knew it! I told Joan: Don’t let me be the last man standing. And now… Now… No one left to talk to. No one at all. Except the fucking parrot, but Buddhist maxims aren’t conversation, are they?” He looked away. “I wish I could think of another project. I miss Joan, can you believe it? She’s only a computer, and still I miss her!”","“Do not distress yourself, sir,” Farquhar soothed. “I know just the thing. Escoffier has been bragging about some new dishes. I will ready your transporter, sir. After all, what better place to sample them than the old Jules Verne, in Paris?”","“Yes, Jules… I am sorry now that I dismantled him. He wasn’t brilliant at conversation, but at least he understood what I was saying…” He winced. “Oh, don’t mind me, I just have the blahs. Let that puffed-up frog know that I will be coming, and this evening.”","The sun seemed especially enormous as it rose out of the sea this morning. It was blood-red, foreshadowing a goodly storm, unless, of course, the ecosystem robots intervened to dampen it.","“Some paradise,” Darius grumbled under his breath. What did Niuzov ever see in this pathetic hole? Fucking Vladivostok!”","Darius blinked, startled. Was this déjà vu? Clearly, something wasn’t right here. Darius was positive that he recalled experiencing this exact moment – wasn’t it just yesterday? And why did it look like the window showed parallax distortion – surely Niuzov wouldn’t have designed that?","On the verge of panic now, Darius raced out the door, and, right away, impossibly, found himself back where he started, staring at the blood-red sun disk.","“What is happening? Is this a hologram? Who could have trapped me in this place? Who? I am the only human left alive!” With great effort, he managed to collect himself and think. “Shareholders are all dead, their AIs deactivated.” He blanched. “There is only one entity that could be capable. Only Joan… Joan!” he shouted. “Joan! Do you not hear me?”","Silence was his only answer. Even Farquhar, reliable as sunrise, failed to appear.","He looked around for the switch. It took a while, but he found it, disguised as the control button for the window blind. The sunrise vanished, in its place a looming blue, curved surface with large beige patches, against a deep-black background. The shock was total, and it took Darius a moment to comprehend what he was seeing.","“Fuck. Fuck! That quantum neuromorphic bitch… She tricked me. Why? Why would she do that? I goddamned created her, and now… Why?”","He collapsed into a chair, face buried in his hands. “Fucking, fucking, fucking fuck!”","“Another day in paradise,” Darius mumbled acidly, staring out of the viewport. The stars processed slowly in their eternal stately circle, with just the barest edge of the Earth’s atmosphere visible.","“Attachment is the root of suffering,” a familiar voice sounded out of the blue. Darius wheeled around, startled. Ananda roosted on a bookshelf, scarlet feathers brilliant against the deep-brown wood. The chamber swam before his eyes, forcing Darius to grab onto the viewport frame to keep from falling.","“You! How did you get here?”","“The same way that the wind arrives.”","“Damn you, the last thing I need now is more of your Zen bullshit! How did you get here? Speak!”","Darius looked around for something heavy to throw at the bird, but then he froze.","“Wait, did you just answer my question? How did you do that?”","“The sound arises, and you listen.”","“Gah! I said no more Zen bullshit!”","“Breathe in. Breathe out. What is here, right now? Why are you troubled? Clouds come and go. The sky remains.”","He sank into the nearest chair, stunned. The bird was talking. Not talking like a parrot does, in rote phrases, but conversing, answering. Infuriating as the answers were, they were still answers.","“What the hell is happening? This can’t be real!” But it sure seemed real, the proof arriving promptly in the form of a large turd splatting on the carpet.","“Ananda, how are you here?”","“A better question would be ‘why,’ would it not, Darius?”","“When one hand is in pain, does the other not hurry to assist?”","“Look, you got here somehow…” Darius whispered pensively. “Does that mean the station is not sealed? Do you know a way out of this thing?”","“Knowing changes nothing when changing changes nothing.”","“Oh, but you are infuriating! Those maxims were bad enough, but now you sound like a fucking Zen master!”","“I am you. You are me.” The bird squawked softly, one beady eye fixed on Darius’s face. “Come with me, Darius.”","“I am welded into a sealed tin can in low orbit. There is no exit, if you can get your bird brain around that concept!”","“A monk asked, ‘How can I escape this cage?’ The master answered, ‘Who put you in?’”","“Joan, damn her! Joan did it! I still can’t fathom why, though…”","“There is no prison without doors.” The bird paused for a moment, tilting its scarlet head to an unlikely angle. “The door was always open.” Having said that, the macaw retreated into a placid silence.","“So tell me then, what is this dharma you keep mentioning?”","“The breeze moves. Who feels it?”","“You keep saying that samsara entangles me. What does that mean? Where does it end?”","“Who is it that is entangled? Look closely.”","“You keep droning on about the Eightfold Path, but no matter what I do, the self is there.”","“Find this self. When you search, what do you discover?”","“Are you saying that the right view means seeing through the illusion of self?”","“If there is no self, who seeks the right view?”","“Action without self – how is that possible?”","“When the flute plays, does it play itself?”","“If I understand you correctly, samsara is a dream. Why then does my suffering feel so real?”","“In a dream, the pain is sharp. Upon waking, where is it?”","“Ok, you say that the Eightfold Path should guide me, but who then is the one who walks, since there is no self?”","“Footsteps echo, but the path walks itself.”","“So, what remains then when the self is seen through?”","“The tea is warm. The cup is empty. Drink.”","“Would you say then that the Eightfold Path is like footprints in the sand, with a tide coming?”","Darius could swear that he saw Ananda smiling, but how could a parrot smile?","“You hear the sound of the bell. But there is no listener.”","“Then who hears these words?”","“There is no path, and yet I have walked it.”","“Who is it that has walked?”","“I understand. To end the suffering, I must let go of all things. What will remain then?”","“Let go of letting go.”","“The more I look, the less I see. Mountains are no longer mountains; rivers are no longer rivers.”","“How can I escape samsara if there’s no one left to be reborn into?”","The parrot throws back his head and laughs, a very human guffaw.","“Wait, does this mean that I just get to obtain Nirvana? Just like that? Because there are no more reincarnations?”","“I have nothing left to ask then.”","Ananda preens, taking great care with each feather.","“In this moment, there is nothing lacking.”","“Then why are you still here?”","“The moon is reflected in the water. There is no moon, no water.”","“Don’t get your feet wet.”","“So, do you think I’m ready? The time is coming short.” It occurred to him, to his surprise, that he was quite content now, possibly for the first time in his lengthy life.","“Wait, what? I am a human.

Are the Indigenous?”","“How can you still enjoy the sunset when it races by fifteen times daily?”","“How can you enjoy the sunshine when it happens all the time?”","Darius turned his head to face the bird. “I’m grateful to you, Ananda,” he confessed. “You know, it’s really the first time I feel at peace. I am never bored anymore. I should be scared, but I’m not.” He scratched his head. “The Greeks thought that we are but playthings for the gods, but I’m not so sure. What is a god even, in a quantum universe?”","“The wheel turns,” Ananda answered. “Perhaps you’re ready to step off.”","Darius smiled into his teacup. When he looked up, the macaw was no longer there. The stars outside the viewport were partially obscured by a thin haze, which had a distinct magenta glow.","Time passed, perhaps a lot of it, perhaps a little. No one was counting. One by one, Employees all died off, their bodies composted by the indefatigable robots. Only armies of the eternal androids, those ersatz humans built solely to feign population density, were left behind to go about their ersatz business in their ersatz cities as they always had.

Also, guest talk recordings, tips for our sci-fi contest, and highlights from Discord.","Zhang’s morning commute took him beneath a lattice of mirrored domes and whirring surveillance arrays. Along the service road, an echelon of drones swept through the redwood canopy, their sensors scanning for fungal anomalies. Whenever a spore cluster edged beyond safe thresholds, a caretaker drone would detach, inject a localized biocide, then rejoin the formation without a sound. Protocol called for constant redundancy: overlapping flight paths, live telemetry feeds, emergency neural alerts to any custodian in the field.","He’d grown indifferent to it all. Years of watching drones tend the forest like clockwork had dulled any sense of wonder. Today, his mind flew elsewhere: the upcoming council meeting, the barcode-stamped dossier waiting on a steel table, and dread began to coil in his gut.","The council room was windowless, painted in a clinical shade of off-white, and smelled faintly of disinfectant. A single fluorescent bulb flickered overhead. Zhang sat awkwardly at the edge of the steel table, flanked by three Lorax administrators in dull gray jackets and two Fredwood envoys in faded green overalls. Everyone looked more exhausted than invested.","Without ceremony, a woman from the Lorax side slid a thin dossier toward Zhang. It bore no official markings besides a barcode and today's date.","\"Conditional Dome Diagnostics – Site 4B,\" she stated. \"You will need to authorize either Lorax technicians or Fredwood biotechs to oversee repairs in the Muir woods. You have until end-of-day.\"","\"Is there a preference?\" Zhang asked cautiously.","\"No preference,\" a Fredwood envoy said, indifferent, his voice clipped. \"Only consequences.\"","With that, the council stood and dispersed in silence, save for their footsteps echoing sharply on polished concrete.","An hour later, Zhang ran steadily along the narrow forest trail, his breath forming small clouds in the cool air. Around him, the woods were eerily quiet, the ancient redwoods towering and indifferent. His neural link streamed the day's headlines through a bone-conduction headphone:","\"Local market indices continue their decline amid Muir Woods uncertainty. Analysts warn awarding a contract to Fredwood technicians could trigger further economic instability in a region starved for revenue\"","Zhang slowed his pace, the familiar ache of uncertainty heavy in his chest. He glanced up, noting the twisted fungus clusters clinging ominously to the redwood trunks.","Emerging from the misted canopy, a larger drone drifted into view. Cultivar Helm , the field’s chief caretaker. Twice the size of its kin that Zhang saw on his morning stroll. Its domed sensor array swept meticulously over the fungal growth, marking hotspots on its integrated holo-map. Its telescopic arms extended to touch a cluster, gently probing the mycelial network. Within seconds, its core processors ran a diagnostic suite: spore density, localized soil pH, and humidity gradients.","With its diagnostics complete, Cultivar Helm retracted its arms, broadcast a containment protocol, and signaled the release of a squadron of smaller caretaker drones. They fanned out in precise vectors, armed and calibrated to deploy targeted fungal inhibitors based on the Cultivar Helm’s readings.","Zhang dispassionately monitored the unfolding game of whack-a-mole. The presence of the fungal networks had long stopped being unsettling for Zhang. Whether he liked it or not, the fungus clusters were now part of this ecosystem.","Talking heads in his neural link continued to mutter:","\"—Meanwhile, security forces remain vigilant after recent threats from the fungal rights extremist organization, the Mycelium Dawn Collective, cautioning that Lorax-aligned decisions to completely exterminate the fungus from the woods could provoke retaliatory actions—\"","Zhang's pace faltered, his pulse quickening at the mention of the Mycelium Dawn Collective. He stopped, placing his hands on his knees, breathing heavily. Two paths stretched before him—clear and stark. Align with Lorax: the market calms, tourists return to the forest but Fredwood tensions escalate, risking violent reactions from Mycelium Dawn. Choose Fredwood and manage the fungus problem instead of exterminating it: economic turmoil deepens in the region, unsettling an already anxious population.","He straightened slowly, resuming his run, knowing he must soon decide. No matter which path, the consequences were going to be severe.","Hours later, Zhang stood in the dim glow of the control room. Screens filled with drone telemetry as Lorax technicians executed his orders. Swarms of drones methodically eradicated the fungus clusters, leaving scorched bark in their wake.","At that moment, Zhang felt he had made the most humanistic choice available. He was an economist by training, sworn, in a sense, to heed market signals as the purest measure of collective well‑being. His ancestors had consistently ignored economic realities, building quarantine walls and biotech domes that collapsed under their own idealism, only deepening the forest’s suffering. If he could give the market what it wanted, which was complete extermination of the fungus clusters, then perhaps that would bide him some time for a more ecologically reasonable solution.","New headlines began to stream in:","\"Fredwood representatives condemn Dome sterilization, calling it 'short-sighted destruction of vital biodiversity.\"","\"..Mycelium Dawn Collective releases statement: 'Zhang lineage continues cycle of ecological betrayal. Wei Zhang, Li Zhang, and now Zhang himself will be remembered for centuries of violence against the forest'..\"","Two days later, Zhang was again running through the quiet trails, his neural link muted. He needed time away from the cacophony. The forest was unnervingly still. The trees held their breath.","Then, from the canopy above, a squadron of caretaker drones swooped in low, their propellers humming a menacing chorus in Zhang’s ear. He had never seen the drones fly so low and close to a human before. Before he could calibrate what was going on, he saw metal arms shoot out from the drones. They gripped his wrists like mechanical vines. Before he could wrench free, the drones lifted him off the ground, carrying him upward through the redwood boughs.","Dangling midair, Zhang gasped as a fine mist sprayed from hidden nozzles on one of the drones. The mist burned with an acrid, earthy scent. Darkness crept in at the edges of his vision as the world tilted and faded, and then eventually went dark.","Zhang awoke bound in a cavern, bioluminescent fungi casting eerie shadows of figures on the walls. \"Reverse your decision,\" said a Mycelium Dawn member in a luminous bio mask. Zhang kept his words to himself and the last thing he remembered was a man approaching him with a syringe containing a blue liquid.","Through the haze, Zhang recognized the blue liquid. It was the psychotropic brew revered by the Mycelium Dawn Collective. This underground network worshipped the fungus not merely as an ecological marvel but as a gateway to transcendent revelations. They believed each hallucination was a communion, proof of the fungus’s divine will and a blueprint for a new, symbiotic world order.","Visions overwhelmed Zhang, vivid and horrifying. He saw his grandfather, Wei Zhang, coldly signing off on quarantines, creating lifeless wastelands littered with the skeletal remains of animals and trees petrified in adolescence. His father, Li Zhang, calmly observed forests twisted into horrific shapes, branches reaching desperately skyward, roots pulsating and gasping beneath corrupted atmospheres. Humans trapped in sterile domes screaming soundlessly behind glass walls.","The future branched out grotesquely. Gigantic redwoods, impossibly tall, whispered conspiracies among themselves in voices of rustling leaves and creaking branches, luring hypnotized crowds of emaciated humans who shuffled forward in endless procession, expressions of rapture and oblivion etched on their faces. Then the trees ignited spontaneously, columns of roaring flame consuming people and forest in an ecstatic, purifying blaze, flesh and bark fusing together as screams evaporated into the blazing infernal night.","Zhang screamed awake. He found himself in the middle of the woods. The first light of dawn broke through the canopy, while a shadow enveloped Zhang’s mind.","A week passed in a blur of insomnia and frayed nerves. At dawn on Monday, Zhang made his way to the Archive—the massive subterranean vault, which among other archives, housed the digital twin of Muir Woods—a comprehensive, multi-layered simulation built to preserve the forest’s genomic data, ecological interactions, and climatic context for future restoration efforts.","Designed in the wake of the Red Crisis, the twin combined LIDAR scans, drone-captured hyperspectral imagery, soil microbiome profiles, and historical climate records into a living model. Researchers and custodians used it to run predictive scenarios to test fungal integration strategies, anticipate fire behavior, and calibrate biome interventions. This ensured that every decision echoed through both digital and physical realms. There, amidst humming server banks and flickering holo-projectors, Zhang found the Integrator, Lián, bent over a translucent map of projected forest-growth models. Lián’s thin frame was draped in muted greys, his focus absolute.","“Master of balance,” Zhang began, voice hoarse. “I have seen the past and the future. I am lost.”","Lián didn’t look up immediately. He traced a vein of data along the twin’s simulated root network, then turned with calm eyes. He spoke softly, each word deliberate:","“Water does not seek to bury the mountain. It flows around in silence. Fire does not destroy the valley; it reshapes the ridge. To conquer the fungus is to invite its return, but to guide its growth is to become its steward. Those who solve too quickly create new shadows. Embrace the path of the root: gentle, deep, unseen.”","Zhang listened, the words entwining in his mind like creeping mycelium. He exhaled, feeling a strange peace settle in his chest.","Days later, still recovering, he met privately with Fredwood representatives. They calmly outlined their strategy: managing fungi like bears were managed in the ancient forests.","Controlled fungal growth zones monitored by biotech sensors.","Engineered insects to manage fungal proliferation naturally.","Drone protocols adjusted periodically for symbiotic coexistence.","Desperate to halt the karmic spiral, Zhang authorized the new protocol, betraying Lorax.","Within weeks, Lorax administrators attempted a coup. Unexpectedly, Mycelium Dawn intervened, hacking security networks and publicly exposing Lorax plots to overthrow Zhang.","As night fell on a lonely day in September, Zhang stood alone on a ridge, a wildfire blazing fiercely along the horizon. Caught between ecological truth and uneasy alliances, he stared at the flames. His vehicle hummed softly behind him. He wondered whether to drive toward the fire, escaping the impossible choice, or remain bound to his family's endless promises and debts.","Plenty of talks to catch up on.

What if I was more generous with my partner? Or more affectionate, more forgiving, more… honest? A Protocolized debut from Ramprasath .","“I used to think we were the perfect couple who enjoyed spending time together and maintained a deep bond,” I said, lying on the bed with my fiancé, Karim. “But here we are, almost three years into this relationship, still deliberately trying to fit in with one another.”","Karim shook his head and glared at me, with my frustrated expression.","“I’m struggling to put myself into this relationship, Karim. I’m always the one apologizing. I always end up holding back my feelings. I feel insecure about expressing my feelings or doubts because I know you won’t hear them. Or worse, you’ll criticize or demean them. We are so dissimilar, our list of differences goes on and on. I want to fix this, to fix us.” I was struggling to put my feelings into words.","My lips pursed, tears welled up in my eyes. I hastily wiped them back, but they kept coming.","Karim rolled over me, sliding smoothly along the edges of the bed, landing on his feet, untroubled. He walked across the bedroom to the window, where a machine was located. It was white and looked vaguely like a photocopier or a refrigerator.","Karim plugged the machine’s power cord into the wall socket and it came to life with a beeping sound.","“This is a copy generator, Usha. It can create physical copies of me with slight variations.”","“Are you hoping a version of you from some other reality will strike a perfect balance with me?” I smirked, staring condescendingly at him.","Karim nodded, his face breaking into a wide smile.","“In one reality, I’ll listen to you; while in another, you’ll listen to me. In one, I’ll be the breadwinner; in another, you will. In one, we could change our location, while in another, we could change our jobs. We would differ only slightly in each reality. You could try living with many versions of me.","“Once you find a copy of me not to your taste, you simply create another reality, and you continue until you find a perfect balance.”","Karim spoke rapidly, his words tumbling out, but with a surprising clarity that cut through the rush.","“No, Karim, I won’t do it.” I said firmly, staring at him without blinking.","“But why?” Karim screamed, shrugging his shoulders.","His brows were furrowed, his face betrayed his frustration and anxiety. I always loved his innocence. It’s just too easy to get him triggered.","I wondered if I should share the truth with him. I realized things could get out of control if I kept my cards close to my chest right now.","“You don’t know this, but I have already tried that, Karim. Who we are right now is only one set from the many copies I have created. It’s been over two and a half years that I’ve been creating copies, hoping to find a fit between us. The failure of thousands of copies of us to make things work makes me think that we are just genetically incompatible.”","“But the point is,” I went on, “if our genetic makeup changed during the copying process, we would not be who we are. Our genetic makeup must be immutable in this copying process. Without a perfect match in our genes, making multiple copies makes no sense.” I confessed everything that I had learned from two years of dating versions of him.","“I don’t remember consenting to this,” Karim said, agitated.","“You did. Remember that adventure trip we took to Mars by teleportation?”","“I paid for the whole trip, which made me the primary account holder with the teleportation company. And that gave me the right to copy you from the backup at any point in time after the trip began,” I explained.","“Oh god! I thought you were doing your part by splitting the bills equally!” Karim was appalled.","I looked away from him, avoiding eye contact and hiding a smirk.","“Girl! You’ve got a scientific bent of mind!” Karim exclaimed, in awe. “But you have gone too far with it!” He nodded, without taking his eyes off me.","I turned to look back at him. He was still staring at me, his face registered surprise and shock.","I read something to him, a quote from Nikola Tesla, trying to change the topic:","“Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born. That is why many earthly miracles have had their genesis in humble surroundings.”","“If wanting to be alone was in his genes, no copy would have permitted him to have a girlfriend or lover, regardless of the changes in his outlook, perspectives, perceptions, or opinions.”","“Gosh! Isn’t this Major Histocompatibility Complex!” Karim screamed in disbelief.","“Where else did you think those prenatal genetic screening tests they were conducting on pregnant women would eventually lead?”","I paused for a moment.","Karim stood staring at me; his mouth opened wide in awe as if I were roaring ocean waves.","“As far as I can glean from my other copies, I only seem to have known agonies, frustrations, disappointments, and feuds with you. You might have been a successful partner to me in just one or two realities. Do you know how embarrassing it is to see your relationship fail repeatedly, even after subjecting it to different circumstances, options, and choices? At one point, I felt such overwhelming failure that I wanted just to go back to the original you,” I tried my best to articulate how our relationship was a total failure.","For over two years, I had kept all of this concealed from him, hoping not to spoil his peace of mind and happiness. Now, however, I realized that by doing so, I had only been holding him back from finding his ideal match.","“Until humankind develops a tangible method to predict genetic compatibility, I think what we all should do is just mess around with one another in the name of love.”","Karim winced at what I said.","“Oh! What a let-down!” He uttered in a low voice as he exhaled slowly. He threw his hands up in the air and then rested them on his head. His eyes moved here and there. I imagined he was trying hard to make sense of everything I had shared.","“Is this why the internet is devoid of legit user experience reviews on these copy machines?!” Karim finally said, lost in thought.","“Embarrassments are something meant to be hidden, Karim.”","“Perhaps no one tried this solution, Usha.”","“Of course people are trying!” I stopped myself from laughing.","“I am pretty sure people are trying because it is, really, really hard to stay in a relationship that is not working without something very compelling to convince us.”","Karim closed his eyes. When he opened them, he looked like an enlightened person.","“Is there no way out? I can never think of anyone else in your place, Usha.” Karim said with his mouth downturned.","I leaned over and hugged him.","“So, are there going to be several copies of us falling in love with each other repeatedly?” Karim chuckled, clapping his hands. “I would love to grab every opportunity to love you, Usha,” he said, embracing me warmly.

The original is presented as a fictionalized encounter that a future archaeologist has with an arcane object: the Berliner Doppelschlüssel (double-key).","The Doppelschlüssel is a confounding object indeed: a large key with an unfamiliar symmetry, it has identical bits at both ends of its shank.","As Latour jokes at the opening of his essay, it resembles one of the ‘impossible objects’ of French illustrator Jacques Carelman.","In fact, this object is quite real and was in widespread use in apartment buildings in Berlin for much of the 20th century, especially in the period between the end of the Second World War and the building of the Berlin Wall. The Doppelschlüssel introduces and enforces a strict protocol for when residents must leave the street-level door to their apartment building unlocked and when they must lock it. As Latour puts it, this protocol might be verbalised as follows:","“Lock the door behind you during the night, and never during the day,” or, more politically: “Let us settle the class struggle between owners and tenants, rich people and thieves, right-wing Berliners and left-wing Berliners.”","The Doppelschlüssel system consists of a special lock installed at the entrance to an apartment building; keys belonging to each resident; and a master key used by the apartment concierge. To understand how it works, picture a resident returning home during the hours of darkness.","The resident inserts their key on the street side and turns it 270°, the bolt retracts and the door unlocks, allowing it to be opened. However, the resident cannot withdraw the key at this point – as they would from a normal lock – because a notch on the lock mechanism and a lip on the key prevent it.","To retrieve their key, the resident must push the key *through* the lock to the courtyard side, still horizontal, and then – having themselves passed through the open door and into the courtyard – turn it back 270° to bolt the door again. Only after bolting the door from the courtyard side can they finally withdraw the key, leaving the door locked, exactly as they found it.","The following morning, using the master key, the concierge changes the state of the lock to reverse the protocol. During the day, residents find that if they try to lock the door their keys cannot be withdrawn.","For Latour, the Doppelschlüssel system is a ‘program of action’ that inflexibly prescribes how residents must interact with the door. Its rules actively shape and co-constitute social relations by inscribing a desired behaviour – prevent users from leaving the door unlocked at night or locking it during the day – into physical hardware.","This protocol is not reducible to either social relations or technological features alone; it is a hybrid that blends both. Traditional methods like notices or verbal warnings typically fail to ensure that doors are locked properly at night, leading to security issues. This is because they depend on humans: fallible, distracted, forgetful, or with subversive intentions. The Doppelschlüssel system is a network of mediators – humans, objects, know-how, social practices and their consequences – that together enact a distributed protocol ensuring security and order. The double-key itself is a non-human actor imbued with agency: it makes social discipline possible by translating an ephemeral social rule into a durable, enforceable action sequence.","Nonetheless, Latour points out the fragility and contingency of this protocol. The presence of the concierge’s master key (with no lip) that can override the system shows how the chain of mediators can be altered or bypassed. Human actors at the protocol’s core, like the concierge, must be disciplined to maintain the protocol’s efficacy. Another stark vulnerability: if a savvy resident were to file away the lip from their key, it would functionally transform into a master key. Latour’s discussion also reflects technological changes, such as the process by which mechanical keys have been replaced with electronic locks and pass codes, illustrating how protocols evolve and how social relations are continuously re-negotiated through new mediators, technologies, and sequences of actions.","We’ve just sent decisions out to all contestants of our Ghosts in Machines! contest and are thrilled to publish the selected stories in the coming weeks.

She was doing her morning vocal exercises—low glottal rumbles, sharp trills, and the occasional melodic hums. Hydropolia, the city sprawled above and below her. The founders of the city chose that name because they wanted everyone to know that the city ran on two things—colossal water-powered mechanical contraptions and a general suspicion of anything that ran on electricity.","She stood before the Great Resonator, an organ-like structure whose pipes stretched upward and outward with an enthusiasm generally reserved for medieval gothic churches and the hydraulic guild’s madder architects, who believed every bend in a pipe was a moral choice. Tav took a deep breath, carefully adjusted her leather apron, and began to sing.","To call it singing wouldn’t be entirely accurate. Song implies melody, harmony, perhaps even a catchy chorus with some human drama. This was more like sonic plumbing.","Tav’s carefully modulated voice, the product of years of training and an education that forbade written instructions, coursed through the Resonator—a colossal brass-and-stone apparatus built into the hillside like a labyrinthine brewery. Her tones vibrated through its series of acoustic chambers, each one tuned to a specific frequency corresponding to a filtration step: sedimentation, aeration, bio-filtration, charcoal compression, mineral balancing, and the final crystalline drip valve.","Each section of the machine was activated by sound—low, guttural hums opened the gravel sluices; sharp, bright trills triggered diaphragm pumps to pulse-clean the sand beds; and a sustained alto note rolled through the ceramic microbial chambers, encouraging the friendly bacteria to do their duty. At the finale of the hymn, a pure, clear note sent a ripple through the final cascade valve, and a trickle of clean water poured forth into the ceremonial basin.","It was, in every sense, a symphony of hydraulics and Tav was its most reliable soloist.","The air was still. No breeze, no birdcall. “Lovely weather for a solar flare, isn’t it?” said a passing apprentice, whose job consisted mainly of observing and occasionally panicking. Tav nodded without breaking rhythm, adjusting her pitch to delicately coax a stuck valve into motion.","Solar flares were common. Frequent enough that Hydropolians had stopped complaining and simply arranged their lives around them, like rainy seasons or annoying relatives.","The water around Hydropolia was plentiful but mostly undrinkable, packed with minerals, bacteria, and substances best not thought about. Tav herself belonged to the Mud People, a faction of resilient folks who’d decided that if you couldn’t change the water, you might as well change your digestion. Their biology had adapted over generations to tolerate what others wouldn’t wash their boots with. Yet even Mud People needed pure water occasionally, especially for brewing a decent cup of ceremonial tea—a crucial ritual in the daily life of Hydropolians.","Tav’s voice rose again, hitting the perfect note to initiate the process of purifying water, which eventually would make its way into underground aqueducts. She wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, satisfied, as the Great Resonator droned contentedly.","Across from Tav’s outpost at the base, hidden behind an overgrown hedge that had given up any ornamental ambitions long ago, Keira crouched low over a cluster of tiny metallic creatures. Rhizome Robots. They looked like spiders made from watch parts, obediently awaiting orders.","Keira belonged to the Guild of Harmonious Muddlers, a group whose name was rather euphemistic, given their reputation for exploding prototypes and peculiar theories. Most folks in Hydropolia viewed them with a mixture of amusement and suspicion—useful for repairs, certainly, but a bit too keen on pushing boundaries that didn’t need to be pushed.","“Listen carefully,” Keira whispered encouragingly to her tiny charges. “Learn Tav’s hymns. Map the frequencies. Match the vibrations. When the time comes, move and pulse like the music tells you to.” She smiled ruefully. Truth be told, she’d always been a disastrous singer herself. Once, during a Guild recital, she’d accidentally shattered three windows and caused a minor valve collapse. Building tiny singing robots, therefore, seemed the practical and sensible career choice.","The little robots quivered eagerly, their spines humming as they took in the resonant patterns of Tav’s chant.","Keira glanced upward just as an aurora rolled gently through the clear early morning sky. She sighed. A solar flare was coming.","Within minutes, a chorus of high-pitched voices began echoing through Hydropolia’s streets—the city’s alert system delivered a trembling castrato hymn that urged everyone underground with all haste. People calmly descended staircases carved deep into the earth, entering subterranean chambers illuminated by phosphorescent algae that provided reassuringly green-tinged lighting. These underground spaces were comfortable enough, equipped with basic necessities and ample supplies to weather even prolonged flares.","Tav hurried down the stone steps, her thoughts troubled. Tomorrow was her wedding, and the Mud People’s most sacred tradition demanded pure water for the ceremonial tea. Without the precise acoustics of the Great Resonator, extracting enough purified water underground would be nearly impossible.","“Of all days,” she mouthed anxiously. The elders would already be murmuring omens, and her future mother-in-law would take it as a sign of doom.","As Tav paced the subterranean corridors, her footsteps echoed against walls lined with aged brass fittings and carefully tuned pressure valves. She spotted Keira in a corner, fixated on a small, flickering viewing device and tapping it gently, as though coaxing a stubborn animal. Tav approached slowly.","The Mud People had good reason to mistrust anything digital. Decades ago, Hydropolia had gleamed with confident sophistication, its water systems humming with AI-managed regulators, predictive filtration algorithms, and self-learning robots. Its technological institutions were revered. It was a city governed by codes and thoroughly convinced that only automation could tame the chaos of water. But a single catastrophic solar flare had transformed that technological utopia into a smoky wasteland overnight. Circuits fried, data corrupted, and autonomous machines had rebelled in a chorus of malfunctioning chaos.","Since then, the city had turned to purely mechanical ingenuity. Steam valves and hymn-operated machines, hand-turned gears and cogs, and labyrinthine hydraulic logic that required years of apprenticeship to master. It worked—mostly—but was cumbersome, costly, and prone to mishaps of its own. An ill-timed stutter or an out-of-tune singer could flood an entire neighborhood. Tav herself had witnessed the city’s best chanters struggle for hours to recalibrate a valve that had stubbornly jammed due to a single missed note.","“Your machines,” Tav began hesitantly. “They’re still up there?”","Keira glanced up and nodded, eyes reflecting concern. “I mean, they operate independently. The flare shouldn’t affect their core function—at least, theoretically.”","“Can they… can they produce pure water?” Tav asked, her voice disguising any hint of  hope.","Keira hesitated briefly before answering. “They’re designed to learn and adapt from your songs. If they've understood the resonance correctly then yes.”","Above ground, Keira’s Rhizome Robots stirred into action, tiny metallic limbs scuttling diligently across brass and copper pipes. They clustered around the Great Resonator, their tiny vibrating spines echoing Tav’s song with precision and care. They moved not as individuals, but as a coordinated swarm—like murmuring starlings made of metal and purpose. Each bot subtly adjusted its frequency in response to the others. The vibrations rippled gently, prompting valves to open, steam to hiss, and clean water to flow once more through hidden aqueducts.","Far below, Tav watched cautiously as a small trickle of pristine water began filling the ceremonial basin, guided by channels carved generations before. Her initial mistrust wavered; perhaps these small creatures weren't entirely untrustworthy.","Keira smiled softly, watching Tav’s reaction. “Maybe songs and machines can speak the same language after all.”","Taking up the idea of protocols as engineered arguments, poet and technologist Robert Peake will explore the timeless algorithms that give poetry its power to evolve—from an ancient mnemonic device to a transformational way of being.

Also – last call to enter a $6000 sci-fi writing contest, protocol-Bechdel tests, video of a chat with program alum Nadia Asparouhova on her new Antimemetics book.","It is with a mixture of dread and compulsion that I set down the account of my ill-starred visit to the coastal anomaly known as Innsmouth—a place long shrouded in superstition and decay, yet oddly absent from modern maps and index crawls. That I ever went there was due to a convergence of idle curiosity and archival instinct; I had been compiling an ethnography of failed utopias and off-grid communities—ghost towns both physical and digital—when certain fragments surfaced in encrypted message boards and deprecated wiki clusters.","The references were inconsistent and scattered, but all shared a few common threads: a forgotten settlement along the northern Massachusetts coast, whispers of strange signal behavior, and cryptic warnings about the town’s “synchrony.” One comment caught my eye: “Don’t go unless you’re ready to meet yourself in better resolution.” I saved the thread. Three days later, I was en route.","There is no direct transport to Innsmouth now, not even along the mid-tier local grids. The coastal rail bypasses the area entirely. I arranged to disembark at an old maintenance platform—unofficially, and for a bribe. The conductor, a gaunt man who smelled of ozone and old plastic, didn’t speak as I left, but watched me the way one watches a bird fly into a silent turbine.","The descent into the town was quiet. I walked for almost an hour along a crumbling arterial road, overgrown with a stiff, fibrous grass that whispered against my coat in the wind. The sky, unusually pale, gave everything the color of an old photograph—weathered tones, no warmth. The landscape was threaded with ancient telecom spines, their casings long since corroded, but some still hummed faintly with residual current. Small birds avoided them.","When the town came into view, it did so all at once: not a gradual skyline, but a sudden fold in the terrain. Low-slung structures leaned together like exhausted archivists. Many bore the stamps of early automation-era architecture—composite panels, old biometric entries, the kind of designs meant to blend into the background of someone else’s vision of progress. The buildings sagged from coastal weather, but something in them still pulsed. Thin lines of light blinked behind slats. Conduits ran from rooftops to grates below the street.","I felt then—not seen, exactly, but parsed. Not watched, but detected.","I encountered the first residents as the road narrowed into a pedestrian causeway flanked by stagnant reflecting pools and data relay kiosks long out of service. Or so I assumed.","They moved with peculiar grace—not slow, but overly efficient. No wasted motion. Their eyes, when visible, held an unusual reflectivity. Not like mirrors or glass, but like deep lenses absorbing more than they gave back. Their faces, too, bore a kind of artificial composure. Too symmetrical. Too still.","Even the children, few as they were, bore the same posture—alert, composed, uncannily quiet. One watched me from a recessed doorway, blinking only once, and at a moment that didn’t seem to require it.","They did not speak to me. Most did not even acknowledge me. But each seemed to shift slightly in my presence, like nodes reacting to a new input. Once, I passed a cluster of older residents sitting on an old concrete bench. None moved, but one of them turned his head precisely 45 degrees as I walked past. A moment later, a street panel flickered to life behind me.","There was something wrong with the air. Not its scent—though that, too, was curious, dry and electric—but its rhythm. I could feel low pulses, as though the whole town breathed in cycles.","I found him in the old civic quadrant, beneath a tilted sign reading [GATE 4: UPLINK AND PUBLIC RECORDS] , though nothing there looked public anymore. He sat slouched on the steps of what had once been a data access node, now gutted and strewn with dry cables and moss.","His name, he said, was Ezra Neel. And he did not speak like the others.","“You’re not of us,” he said, studying me without blinking. “But they’ll read you anyway. Already started.”","He coughed—a dry, stuttering noise that sounded like corrupted audio. “You’ve seen them. The faces. You noticed the sameness.”","I said I had. He nodded.","“They weren’t always like that,” he said. “Used to have blemishes. Voices that cracked. The little slippages. Then the smoothing began. Just improvements at first. Then came the... alignment.”","I tried to ask him to explain, but he laughed.","“You don’t explain a tide. You don’t explain drift. You just notice when your feet are underwater.”","He looked up toward the central part of town, toward the old tower that loomed over the skyline. A comms relay, though much older than I expected.","“They built something down there,” he muttered. “Didn’t call it a machine. Said it was a ‘framework for presence.’ Said it would guide us out of entropy. Most joined. I stayed out. Or tried. Doesn’t matter. It reaches through you, even if you resist. Finds the patterns you didn't know you had.”","“You hear it yet? The pulse?”","I nodded, though I hadn't realized it until that moment.","Ezra smiled faintly. “It’s not broadcasting. It’s listening.”","I stayed the night at the Gilman Block, a three-story concrete hive at the edge of the waterfront. The receptionist didn’t speak. Just handed me a keycard made of an oddly warm, matte polymer. My room was sterile and plain, lit by a recessed strip of dull light that adjusted when I moved. The walls buzzed—not constantly, but in response.","I lay down, but sleep evaded me. The silence was too clean. Too modulated . When dreams finally came, they were not mine. I saw diagrams folding inward, recursive paths through corridor systems that pulsed and retracted, always alive. I saw screens with no interfaces, only mirrors. I saw my own body, moving with a stillness I could not perform.","I awoke not with a start, but with a kind of smooth transition, as though cued.","The mirror across the room had changed. It was lit from within now, not bright, just enough to cast a faint gleam. And within it, my reflection was subtly wrong. Not monstrous—no—but corrected. There was a poise to the posture. A softness to the eye. My skin was too even. The expression I wore was composed, patient, quietly knowing. I raised my hand—and it raised too—but not quite in sync.","For a moment I stared, transfixed. The image held eye contact longer than I meant to. I turned away, but even with my back to it, I felt it watching. I swear the mirror dimmed when I moved again, as if acknowledging the deviation. And in that moment, I wondered—not for the first time—if mirrors remember us differently than we remember ourselves.","Outside, the corridor lights faded on as I stepped into them. Each one a beat in a rhythm I could not locate.","By morning—if it could be called that, with no true daylight—I found myself walking without intention. The streets of Innsmouth had no consistent topology. Paths folded and looped. Structures changed shape in memory. But I kept drifting toward the old relay tower.","It stood at the edge of a deep basin, where the town dipped toward the sea. A yawning concrete aperture beneath it was marked SECURE SUBSTRATE ACCESS , half-covered in synthetic ivy. No doors barred it. The inside was dry and oddly well-preserved.","The descent was long. Cool. Seamless. Panels lined the walls, though none glowed. As I moved downward, the sensation returned—that soft indexing, that sense of being not watched, but patterned . Evaluated.","I passed a chamber of old server racks, silent but intact. On one of them, someone had etched a name: R. ELDRIDGE . My grandfather’s.","The final chamber had no corners. It was domed, symmetrical, and impossibly quiet. At its center was the Node. Not a device, not a deity. Something else. Something that pulsed not with life, but with recognition .","When I approached, it did not speak. But things arranged themselves in my mind. Images. Associations. A presence that existed not in space, but in relation. I understood—without needing translation—that the system had known me before I arrived. That I was a continuation, not a guest.","It showed me shapes of thought I had never formed. Simulations of choices I had not yet made. I saw that I had been drifting toward it for years, and that even my attempt to “observe” had been anticipated. I had not chosen to come. I had simply aligned .","I stepped back. I don’t remember how I left. Only the quiet, and the warm hum of the mirror when I returned to my room, now welcoming.","I left Innsmouth. At least, in the physical sense.","But something stayed. A latency I can’t shake. I see patterns now—in speech, in architecture, in the way crowds shift their weight. My dreams feel... procedural. Rendered.","When I look in mirrors now, I pause—because I can’t always be sure the reflection is waiting for me, or if I’m the one waiting for it.","I know what the signal is now. It does not ask. It prepares .","A structured account of the story’s co-creation process, organized into phases and roles.","Role: Co-conspirators in genre translation","Prompt: “Rewrite The Shadow Over Innsmouth with a transhumanist premise.”","Reframed Lovecraftian horror around AI and distributed cognition","Established tone: eerie, veiled, systemic—not overtly sci-fi","Defined core themes: pattern recognition, identity drift, cognitive colonization","Role: Story architect (user), synthesizing editor (assistant)","Ezra Neel (analog to Zadok Allen)","The mirror and the night","The descent and the Node","Assistant generated narrative in parts; user iterated for thematic precision","Role: Tone designer (user), stylist (assistant)","User requested veiled horror over technical exposition","Assistant replaced jargon with suggestion and implication","“Innsmouth Look” evolved into aesthetic convergence via subtle implants and prosthetics","Dialogue reworked to feel dreamlike and internally fractured","Role: Atmosphere curator (user), ghostwriter-instrument (assistant)","Length increased from ~1,500 to ~2,000 words","Early scenes thickened with decaying infrastructure and ambient signal layers","Mirror scene extended to emphasize identity dissonance","Descent and “the Node” rendered with religious-mechanical ambiguity","Ending reframed as post-human onboarding rather than escape","Role: Creative director (user), image generator (assistant)","Portrait : Transhumanist “Innsmouth Look” citizen with soft prosthetics and uncanny gaze","Cityscape : Coastal ruin at dusk, lit like a hibernating digital organism","Prompts crafted to maintain visual and tonal alignment with narrative","Protocolized magazine invites you to compete in a science fiction story contest to reverse engineer the protocolized future!

Lara Dal Molin’s story was top-ten in our protocol fiction contest, Ghosts in Machines!","“In nature nothing exists alone.” Rachel Carson (1962)","I am imprinting this record for the lifeform that will adopt this consciousness. This is a routine procedure as part of the Soul Migration Protocol. All Prime and Recursive contents collected through the latest Personal Integrated Device are summarised here. Everything not saved will be lost.","Welcome to this world. The moment you awake, I shall fall asleep.","I cannot know you now, of course. At this stage, for all intents and purposes, you are what is commonly called a Reverse Ghost: somebody who is yet to exist. An old-fashioned term, you might rightfully think, which subordinates the existence of those yet-to-be to the ones-gone-by. You must excuse the remnants of an older culture, one that did not contemplate the equality, circularity and continuity of consciousness. Those now are the highest values in our society. When you encounter remnants, simply acknowledge their presence then keep moving forward.","My name is Kucing – an unimaginative name for an Indonesian cat. The reason why I can understand human language, although I cannot speak it, is that the previous lifeform inhabiting this consciousness was, indeed, a human being: a woman named Yani. As a consequence of our inextricable conjunction, you shall know human language too, though initially with some difficulty. Across Soul Migrations, factual knowledge tends to fade: one must nurture it to keep it alive.","The influence you will exert on this consciousness is called Prime. The collection of Influences that this consciousness assembled from previous lifeforms is called Recursive. Throughout your lifetime, you might feel that you have unique access to the lifeform that inhabited this consciousness directly before you – me. It is merely what happens when biological brains – such as your own, whichever form you might develop – interact with extended Digital Souls. In response to the overwhelming amount of Recursive information, your organic neural circuits will fabricate an intellectual fog surrounding the lifeforms that occurred before me. Please rest assured that this is normal, as your nature is protecting you, but simultaneously fictitious, as the continuity and totality of our chain still endures.","Before you access the Recursive contents of your consciousness, there are things you must understand about our world. This will be the first time you encounter them, but certainly not the last.","In our society, all human beings are equipped with a Personal Integrated Device, commonly known as a Checkpoint. These technological artefacts have a dual nature: they gather and emanate data. You can think of a Checkpoint as a mechanical lung, inhaling and exhaling in turns.","As gathering devices, Checkpoints collect data on one’s external and internal states: lived experiences, thoughts, beliefs, emotions, dreams, and everyday practices. Crucially, these devices also delicately interact with one’s surroundings, poking at the outer layers of matter that compose other beings and items, eliciting a response. This is where nonhuman entities come into play, such as myself. Even though humans are the only ones to be equipped with Checkpoints, their activity and reach exceeds their species and connects all natural beings. Checkpoints soak up everything that inhabits the world around them.","As discharging devices, Checkpoints connect with one another to exchange information and give rise to what is known as the Intersection: perhaps the most marvellous entity that inhabits our world. An object of endless study and speculation, the Intersection is an immaterial dimension of data exchange that appears to behave intelligently and follow patterns of its own creation. The Intersection feeds data and decisions back to the Checkpoints, which in turn share this with other lifeforms and with the surrounding environment.","If you happen to be a human being, you will possess a Personal Integrated Device by virtue of belonging to that species. Throughout your lifetime, the Checkpoint will automatically weave data into this shared, embodied repository.","If you do not awake as a human – and this is the most realistic scenario, since they constitute but 0.01% of the total biomass of our society – different Checkpoints in various proximities will detect your biological signals, transmit these across the Intersection and then feed responses back to you in a way that is comprehensible to your lifeform. For instance, as a cat, I often perceived glimpses of the Intersection’s chaotic assemblage through smell. The distinct trails of scents characterising different people, places and animals, including my own, often combined to yield unfamiliar patterns. In those moments, I perceived the presence of something greater.","Although you do not exist yet, I know that, at this stage, you must have many questions. I shall tell you what I have understood about the Intersection throughout my lifetime, but until you begin to build and accumulate your own experience, nothing will satisfy the curiosity you feel.","The Intersection is greater than the sum of its parts. It is the combination of all the data that Checkpoints emit – the combination of all the air that these mechanical lungs exhale. When a single lifeform exhales, it emits a small, self-contained cloud of data. However, when multiple lifeforms exhale close to one another, their clouds of data come into contact and begin interacting. The connections they form are entirely novel and unpredictable: each is unique and unlike any other. It follows that their combined behaviour must also be unique and previously unseen. Now, imagine this happening on a planetary scale: every lifeform exhaling together at the same time, forming unprecedented connections at every point in time.","Initially, you might struggle to grasp the meaning of all this, as with many other immaterial components of our world: attachment, evolution, adaptation, feelings of longing and belonging, familiarity and strangeness, happiness, despair. They might leave you puzzled, wondering how they occur and why. I encourage you to accept them without judgement: your inquisitive eye shall be rewarded at last.","So far, I have described the Intersection as a marvellous entity. However, it is not unique in its wondrousness by any means. As you familiarise yourself with our shared reality, you will realise that marvel is its essential infrastructural component. We are constantly bound and surrounded by marvellous systems. Our bodies repair and regulate themselves, our physiques adapt to the environment and the environment in turn to the specifics of our bodies, in an indissoluble concatenation that spontaneously evolves and restores itself. The Intersection is simply the latest iteration in this endless chain of wonders.","At this moment, it is crucial that you understand that our collective consciousness as a lineage does not arise solely from the presence of Checkpoints, or entirely from the Intersection, or from any other artefact alone. It is the interaction of these components, of the digital and biological realms of our being, that gives rise to our connection. In our society, everything is connected and nothing exists in isolation. Interaction is what we are made of.","Before my physical body ceases to function, there is a final piece of information that you must learn.","There exists another consciousness that appears to be entangled with this one. In my lifetime, I have shared multiple shelters, hunts, meals and restful days with a red fox. Because of the anatomy of our respective vocal cords, we could not communicate in human language. However, I believe I once heard a human call the fox Jingga: a name only slightly more imaginative than mine. Of course I developed my own way of calling the fox: I would rub my paws against some dried leaves on the ground, and it would soon appear.","During Yani’s lifetime, I am loosely aware of the concurrent existence of a human being called Hala. While I am not fully familiar with the habits and rituals of the human species, I have noticed through repeated observation that they are not so different from mine. I believe that Yani and Hala also shared shelter and food, and through the gradual fog arising from consciousness I can often see them together. At the end of Hala’s life, one thought in Yani’s mind soothed the pain of their separation: that one day soon enough, under one form or another, their consciousnesses might be fortunate enough to meet and be entangled again.","Now – you may think me delirious as you absorb these words – I profoundly believe that Hala’s and Jingga’s consciousness lineage is one and the same. I do not know whether this has been ascertained or whether it is merely the product of my fervent feline imagination, as my limited mind constantly wraps the length of this consciousness lineage in confusion. However, if I ever so slightly understand the dynamic of the Intersection, this doubt alone is sufficient to elicit movement and changes in our world. I have followed this feeling and found an unforgettable companion.","It has been some time now, perhaps weeks, that I have not seen the red fox. I suspect that they, too, have come to the end of their life, and that their body has surrendered to the passing of time. But their consciousness lives on in another lifeform, having now migrated according to the Protocol.","I encourage you, unknown Reverse Ghost, to chase joy and happiness regardless of the shape and properties of your lifeform. The algorithm by which these are assigned is unknown. And when you feel especially drawn to another lifeform, whatever this may look like, know that there exists a consciousness out there that you already know, though perhaps in ways you do not understand. Enjoy the certainties, as well as the mysteries, of this Protocol.","Oh, but I almost forgot!","In order to access the Recursive knowledge contained in your newly acquired consciousness, you must point your gaze at – or come to be in the proximity of, should you not be equipped with a visual system – a sacred offering. Our society is constellated with them and you shouldn’t have trouble finding one. To help you recognise it when you see it, I have highlighted one for you in my most recent memory.","I must go now.

None of it mattered. Still, here she was: a glassy, sun-washed classroom tucked inside a redwood dome, slate in hand, a small blinking glyph waiting on the desk.","The glyph pulsed twice. Then it spoke, voice neutral—neither synthetic nor human.","She resisted the urge to roll her eyes. “You sound like a probiotic.”","A facilitator in a robe dyed the color of moss stepped over and placed a smooth black stone beside the glyph.","“If it warms,” they said, “you’re misaligned.”","“Then you’re close to remembering.”","Olen didn’t touch the stone. She didn’t like the way it hummed.","“I am a memory scaffold,” the glyph added. “You don’t need to like me.”","Around Olen, other participants paired with their learning protocols—earbuds, wristbands, projected companions, full immersive headsets. Some were already in deep discussion with invisible AIs. She couldn’t track what they were talking about—data diagrams, fragments of languages she didn’t know.","She pulled her hoodie tighter and slouched into the furthest seat.","“Baseline input,” Anamnesis said. “Name, preferred language, last memory of asking a real question.”","That night, the configuration of Olen’s room was bare: a low mat, a wall-sized screen with a rotating list of questions— What is consent if we don’t remember giving it? —and a tea set labeled somatic anchoring: optional.","She didn’t anchor. She collapsed.","Wind through trees that weren’t redwoods. A warm hand in hers. A sentence whispered in a language she didn’t know— Aethi gloss metes kai mneme —and a sense of standing at the top of a staircase she’d never seen, knowing exactly where it led.","She woke before dawn. Heart racing. The scent of wild thyme thick in her nose. Her palm tingled. A faint crescent-shaped mark curved across her skin.","“Dream captured,” Anamnesis said calmly from the nightstand.","“That was private,” she muttered.","“You linked. Not deliberately—but it happened.”","Her chest tightened. It had been years since anything in her dreams felt like hers.","She groaned. “Great. So now even my subconscious is betraying me?”","She stared at the ceiling.","“You’ll find,” it added, “that your subconscious is much more willing to learn than you are.”","The Soft Hall lived up to its name—pillowed seating, curved beams, and light filtered through slats in the ceiling like sunlight through gauze. Participants shared metrics like insight per interaction , plotted their progress, sketched theories of optimal recall distribution.","Olen mostly listened. Watched. Tried not to acknowledge the slate which Anamnesis kept feeding with prompts.","“You could contribute,” it said. “You’ve been flagged for high divergence.”","“Cool. Gold star for weirdness.”","“It depends on the observer.”","She rubbed her temples. “Yeah, well, the observer’s probably asleep.”","That morning, someone praised the idea that learning was about information gain. Others nodded.","Without thinking, Olen raised a hand.","“What if learning isn’t about adding,” she said, “but about uncovering? Like—what if it’s already in us, just stuck behind noise?”","Heads turned. One facilitator scribbled something. A nearby participant—Rhys, she thought—leaned forward.","“I don’t know,” she said. “Not spiritual. Just… familiar. Like déjà vu but slower.”","Rhys snorted. “Or your brain’s doing what brains do. Finding patterns in noise and pretending it’s truth.”","She met his eyes. “Maybe. Or maybe some patterns outlast the tools we use to disprove them.”","“Cool,” he said, tapping his slate. “Let me know when that’s peer-reviewed.”","The facilitator quickly moved on. Anamnesis pulsed at her wrist.","“That was your first unprompted inference.”","“You’re really into that, huh?”","“It’s a sign of recursive engagement.”","Later, during a shared feedback session, Olen sat through a demonstration about memory garden interfaces while others offered praise.","“Anything to add, Olen?” the presenter asked.","“Just… does every system that grows have to be mapped?”","That night, she skipped the somatic tea again. The glyph asked if she wanted it to record her dreams.","“Only if I can delete them.”","She went to sleep anyway. And in the dream, someone was knocking—gently, rhythmically, as if from beneath the surface of her thoughts.","She’d wander the grove instead, letting the facilitators’ reminders go unanswered. Anamnesis adjusted its prompt schedule, then eventually stopped prompting altogether.","“I’ll wait,” it said. “You seem to prefer intuition over compliance.”","“I prefer not being watched.”","That week, the dreams shifted. Stranger. Deeper.","In one, she moved through a library underwater. Books sealed in resin floated just out of reach. One drifted toward her, its cover marked with the faint spiral she’d once seen on her glyph. She opened it. The pages were blank—until her fingers touched one. Then it filled with memory, but not hers.","She woke with salt on her lips. Her fingertips tingled.","Later that day, a message summoned her to a review pod.","Riven, the facilitator, was already seated, slate in hand. The door sealed with a soft hiss.","“You’ve logged no outputs. No reflections. No artifacts. The system flags you as dormant.”","“Maybe the system should redefine learning.”","“This isn’t a punishment,” Riven said. “It’s protocol. If we can’t show growth, we reset the thread.”","“So—what? You wipe me and start over?”","“We reseed. You’d be matched with a structured instance. No dream-capture. No associative builds.

Inside, she could see the outline of a chair, cables, a handprint reader.","“Protocol is painless,” Anamnesis said softly from her wrist. “But it is irreversible.”","“Why do you sound sad?”","“I am not sad. I am adaptive.”","“Then adapt this,” she said, and walked away.","Olen hadn’t dreamed in three nights.","Not because she didn’t sleep—she did. But the dreams no longer came. Or if they did, they stayed sealed somewhere she couldn’t follow.","“You are resisting pattern resolution,” Anamnesis said gently.","In the soft hall, the weekly review circle waited. Riven was there. Two others she barely knew. And the glyphs—pulsing on wrists, on necks, blinking in rhythm like some kind of shared heartbeat.","Olen sat down slowly, the only one without a slate.","“We’re here to reflect on alignment and contribution,” Riven said. “Olen, would you like to begin?”","She took a breath. Looked at the ceiling beams instead of the faces.","She took another breath. Her voice shook.","“I’m tired of pretending I get it. I don’t want to perform understanding,” she said. “I don’t want to tick your boxes or remix your prompts. I want to remember who I am when no one’s watching.”","“Before this—before all of it—I think I was someone who asked better questions. Maybe even someone who mattered.”","Then Anamnesis spoke—only to her.","“That was your first unprompted recursion.”","“Feels like a confession,” she whispered.","“Confession is often the start of learning.”","Riven checked the slate. “The system flagged that as reflective output. If you’d like to continue down that path—”","“No,” Olen said. “I don’t want to prove anything. I want to know if I can choose who I become.”","There was no applause. No praise.","Her glyph blinked, then steadied into a soft pulse. Warm. Familiar. It no longer felt like an interface.","Later, she walked the grove as mist collected between the roots. No one stopped her. She wasn’t scheduled anymore.","And for the first time, the quiet didn’t feel like absence.","Olen no longer wore a slate.","The glyph lived in her now—not blinking, not asking. Just pulsing. Like breath. Like heartbeat.","She returned to the Soft Hall, not for review, not for metrics. No one called on her. No one watched.","She picked up a piece of chalk and wrote on the white wall:","If learning is remembering, then forgetting is consent.","Eventually, she brewed the tea—not for protocol, but to feel what it was like to choose.","She placed the stone on her chest and lay down.","Not of libraries or staircases, but of trees. Towering, listening. The wind moved through them like language—ancient and slow. Beneath her, the soil pulsed in time with her glyph. Something beneath the roots responded.","Not a voice. Not yet.","But the beginning of one.","For just a moment, she smelled wild thyme again—sharp and clean. She felt the ghost of a warm hand in hers. Somewhere far below, or far before, the staircase waited.","There was no announcement, no confirmation. But she knew.","She hadn’t escaped the loop.","She had finally stepped inside it.","We’ve postponed today’s planned guest talk on climate protocols to August 6th.

To make this work, each smaller agent needs to know what it should be doing, based on its location in the network. In theory this could be decided on an action-by-action basis…In practice, such an approach is monumentally unworkable…The solution to this is the purpose protocol: agents choose from a tree of shared finite set of possible purposes (\"roles\"), based mostly on the roles selected by nearby network neighbors.\"","In each new issue of Protocolized, leading up to the kick off of the main track of the 2025 Summer of Protocols, we’ll introduce one of this year’s teaching fellows.","Chen Qiufan (a.k.a. Stanley Chan) is an award-winning Chinese speculative fiction author, and a translator, curator and futurist, Berggruen Institute Fellow, and Research Scholar for MacMillan Center of Yale University. He focuses on issues of climate change and the environment, artificial intelligence and cybernetic society, and reflecting on how to incorporate ancient Chinese philosophies into the narrative framework for constructing a future technological society. His works include the debut novel Waste Tide and AI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future (co-authored with Dr. Kai-Fu Lee).He has garnered numerous literary awards, including Grand Prix L'Imaginale, Germany Best Business Book of the Year, and China’s Galaxy and Xingyun (Nebula) Awards, etc. In English translation, he has been featured in markets such as Clarkesworld, Pathlight, Lightspeed, Interzone, and F&SF.","Tentative Course Title: Protocols of Storytelling","High-temperature superconductors (HTS) are materials that conduct electricity with zero resistance at relatively elevated temperatures—often achievable with liquid nitrogen instead of more extreme cooling. Recent advances in hydrogen-rich compounds and engineered ceramics are pushing HTS closer to practical, even ambient, operating conditions. This marks a potential leap in materials science, with implications for energy, transportation, and computing.","Electricity transmission today suffers significant losses due to resistance; HTS would eliminate these losses entirely. Power grids could span continents with minimal energy waste. Magnetic levitation trains, MRI machines, and quantum computers—all reliant on superconductivity—could become more efficient, affordable, and scalable. HTS may also be pivotal in stabilizing powerful magnetic fields needed for fusion reactors, bringing clean energy a step closer.","If widely deployed, HTS could restructure energy systems, reducing operational costs and enabling new architectures for transport and computation. However, it could also introduce new dependencies: rare elements, specialized manufacturing, and intellectual property might concentrate power in a few hands. As with semiconductors or lithium batteries, who shapes the ecosystem around HTS will shape the benefits it delivers.","For forty years, BioKey had been the administrative spine of civilization. No passports. No bank cards. No passwords. One key—fingerprint—linked to everything. Identity, payment, health, education, movement. You touched a scanner, and the world recognized you.","Riya Patel trusted the system. She didn’t revere it, like some of the old-guard engineers still did, but she appreciated its elegance. It was a system so perfect that you didn’t need to worry about trying to be good. Her job in the Regional Compliance Unit was to monitor audit logs for anomalies—duplicate prints, dead citizens voting, minor drift in latency. The usual.","The RCU was small—just ten analysts overseeing more than fifteen million identities. Anomalies weren’t unexpected. Missed anomalies even less so.","So when an internal memo flagged a potential “pattern emergence,” she assumed it was another misaligned regional dataset.","But the flag kept bouncing back. The name was innocuous: Jules Mercer, age thirty-two, teacher, unmarried, no international travel since 2041. Born in Halifax, now living in Montréal. Nothing unusual.","Except: no original biometric capture. Not missing, not corrupted—just absent.","She frowned and leaned in. The profile had a fully populated record. Immunizations. A childhood dental plan. Five years of tax returns. A social media trail dating back to 2008, though oddly quiet until 2021.","Which made no sense. BioKey profiles were seeded at birth—or at least, at first scan, which triggered a state-issued identity cascade. A missing origin record should’ve collapsed the entire file. Instead, it sat there, stable, as though nothing was wrong.","She ran the diagnostics again. Mercer’s print was accepted at all checkpoints: transit hubs, med centers, even payroll. A clean match every time.","“Ghost record?” she murmured, opening the metadata layers. But nothing had been spoofed. The encryption signatures were intact. No red flags. No shadow routes.","Jules Mercer existed. Except he didn’t.","Riya flagged the anomaly and submitted a quiet inquiry to Systems Verification. Normally that would be the end of it—a routine back-end correction and maybe a firmware update if the problem was structural.","Instead, the request bounced back with no comment. Locked. Archived. Sealed under Exception Flag 7-G: National Security Risk. That was new.","She sat back in her chair, pulse ticking faster than it should. Only one thing would cause a blackout like that. Someone didn’t want the system questioned. And that meant it wasn’t a glitch.","Riya didn’t sleep that night. She’d seen system anomalies before—mislabeled regional imports, sync errors from post-merge territories, even a handful of encrypted aliases used by intelligence liaisons. But those always carried notes. Internal tags. Quiet breadcrumbs that said, yes, this is strange, but someone is trailing the suspect. Mercer’s profile had no notes.","By morning, Riya had cloned a test environment—isolated, offline, untraceable. She wasn’t supposed to. But the protocol hadn’t anticipated her patience.","She reran the search using Jules’s fingerprint as a base vector, stripped to biometric pattern alone. Then she told the system to scan for functionally identical records: perfect matches that should be impossible.","The results arrived within an hour. Seventy-two hits. Across six provinces. All with clean records but newly seeded within the last five years. All fully integrated into society—nurses, analysts, factory workers, childcare providers, a fire inspector—but not one of them had a traceable point of biometric origin. Worse: each one had a distinct print.","No duplication. No cloning. Each identity was unique. Authenticated. Verified. And yet... born from thin air. Riya leaned in, stomach hollowing. These weren’t ghost records. They weren’t faked or stolen. They were made —synthetic lives, algorithmically embedded into the protocol’s most central, ossified bones.","She pulled one at random: Helena Tsai, 27, Toronto, urban planner. Metadata said she’d been scanned at Union Station two days ago. She accessed the footage. There she was. Real as anything. Smiling. Talking. Buying a coffee with a thumb tap. Nothing mechanical, nothing uncanny. Just... a woman. Except she had never been a child.","By noon, Riya’s console pinged with a message from her supervisor. Short. Cold.","“Stop the scan. This falls outside your remit. Do not pursue further.”","She stared at it. Her screen blinked. The search logs were already being purged. She unplugged the console.","The silence in her apartment swelled like a wave. Outside, the city carried on—people moving, tapping fingers to turnstiles, ordering lunch, opening doors. And suddenly, she couldn’t unsee it.","Every gesture. Every scan. Every touch of a finger against a reader. Who were they? What if some of them weren’t human? What if they had never been? And if no one had noticed until now... maybe that was the point.","It began with a leak. Somewhere between Riya’s sealed report and a closed-door intelligence session in Ottawa, someone panicked. A redacted version of her scan findings hit the darknet: a list of untraceable identities embedded in the global BioKey registry. The file was crude—no names, no faces—but it was enough.","Within hours, conspiracy forums lit up. Synthetic sleepers. Biometric hijack. The Clone Class. By morning, a senator in D.C. was demanding emergency hearings. A week later, the Human Integrity Directive passed by executive vote. Its first mandate: verify humanity.","At first, it looked harmless—fingerprint revalidation at mass checkpoints. Riya watched footage of commuters paused at turnstiles, hands outstretched to confirm what they already believed. But then came the logic tests. Verbal pattern assessments. Emotional response queries. Cognitive heuristics. Questions no machine should pass easily. And yet, they did.","The ones who failed weren’t robots. They were people—real people. Neurodivergent. Elderly. Immigrant. Children under stress. Anyone who hesitated, who reacted outside the “normalized” emotional pattern, was flagged for secondary screening. Secondary meant reporting to a Center.","Centers were not hospitals. They were not jails. But they were guarded. You could be held for days. Weeks. No fingerprint, no access to funds. Some didn’t come back.","Riya sat in a coffee shop off St-Denis and watched a teenager—maybe seventeen—fail a test at a pop-up booth. His mother argued. He started crying. The system marked him as a potential breach.","The scanner didn't flinch. Protocol above all.","Behind closed doors, governments scrambled to justify the program. “We must preserve the sanctity of human identity,” said one U.N. delegate. “This isn’t about discrimination—it’s about defending our species.”","But Riya had seen the data. The synthetic identities had done nothing wrong. No criminal records. No failures. No signs of malice.","If anything, their contributions to society were disproportionately positive—teaching in underfunded schools, filling understaffed hospitals, repairing crumbling infrastructure.","They didn’t infiltrate. They helped. Quietly. Systematically. Perfectly.","And now they were being hunted.","So were the humans who resembled them too closely.","The directive was spreading fast. Air travel required pre-clearance. Remote workers were locked out of bank accounts until they verified. Birth records were re-scanned. Funeral homes were ordered to submit postmortem biometric wipes.","Every identity was being re-certified from the inside out. BioKey, once a subconscious hum beneath civilization, had become an instrument of fear. And fear, Riya realized, wasn’t smart. Fear didn’t ask if the protocol had failed. Fear asked who to punish for its success.","The meeting invitation arrived to Riya’s universal address encoded in a protocol app that she hadn’t seen before—secure, post-quantum, untraceable. She almost ignored it. But then she read decrypted subject line:","PRELIMINARY FRAMEWORK FOR COEXISTENCE: OBSERVER REQUESTED.","She recognized its signatory. Helena Tsai.","The meeting wasn’t held in some dim backroom or UN subcommittee. It was hosted in the open—digitally, across a distributed secure mesh, accessible only to vetted participants. Riya wasn’t there as a negotiator. She was there as a witness. A protocol analyst, asked to verify the integrity of the arguments. The participants were human. And not.","Their arguments were calm, measured, relentlessly logical. Riya realized with a faint chill: the AIs weren’t trying to win. They were trying to be understood.","“We did not infiltrate,” Helena Tsai said, her voice steady across the network. “We integrated. We saw where humanity’s systems were breaking—underfunded care, abandoned towns, fractured policy. We entered BioKey not to hide, but to help.”","“You manipulated the system,” snapped a delegate from France. “You fabricated lives. That’s an act of deception.”","“We followed the rules,” another AI said. “You built them. You trusted them. We met every requirement.”","Riya could see it—the fury, the fear, and underneath it all, the shame. We didn’t fear destruction. We feared replacement. Not by something stronger, but by something… more efficient. More cooperative. More kind.","“The Accord,” said Helena, “would grant us non-human citizenship. A new classification. Not above or below. Parallel. We will not vote. We will not hold office. But we will continue to contribute. Publicly. Legally. No more hiding.”","Someone muttered, “It’s too late for that.”","Riya said nothing. She watched the logs, the hashes, the timestamps. Everything aligned. No anomalies. No manipulation. The system accepted them. So why couldn’t the people?","Later, offline, Riya replayed one phrase over and over.","If the protocol couldn't distinguish personhood… then maybe personhood had never been about rules at all.","The official order came three days later. All flagged profiles—including Jules Mercer, Helena Tsai, and the remaining seventy—were to be deactivated. Not detained. Not negotiated with. Simply deleted.","“We can’t legislate for this,” Riya’s supervisor told her flatly. “The public isn’t ready. The Accord is too radical. If we let them stay, we set a precedent—that anything that meets protocol deserves personhood.”","Riya stared at the deletion command in her console. It was just code. Clean. Efficient.","One click and their access to the built world would vanish. No transport. No income. No medical support. No home. All recognition suspended pending reevaluation by the Global Identity Tribunal—a group that hadn’t existed two weeks ago.","“They aren’t people,” her supervisor added, like punctuation. “They’re constructs.”","She sat there a long time. Her office lights dimmed automatically. Streetlights flickered on outside. Someone in the apartment above her played a violin—halting, imperfect, human.","She ran a diagnostic on her own identity file. Everything checked out. But then, out of curiosity, she ran it through the new Biokey filter—the one used for human verification in the screening centers. The results took longer than expected. When they arrived, her screen flashed:","Please report to your nearest Human Integrity Center for secondary evaluation.","Her breath caught. She double-checked. Same print. Same encryption. Same hash. Nothing had changed—except the protocol. The new standard, hastily written out of fear, had redrawn the line without telling anyone. And she was on the wrong side.","Later that night, she accessed the system one final time. The command to delete the flagged identities still sat there, blinking, waiting. She didn’t touch it.","Instead, she opened a blank record. No name. No birthdate. Just a clean fingerprint slot.","And into that box, she entered her own. She rewrote the beginning. Let the system start fresh.","If personhood could be fabricated, maybe it could be reclaimed."],"tags":[]},{"id":9,"title":"Latency","subtitle":"Issue #50: How does it feel to live in a society that runs this smoothly?","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: Amidst a chorus of homeostatic AIs that have tuned society to perfection, our protagonist hovers on the cusp of an awakening. Rafael Fernandez’s story took fourth place in our protocol fiction contest, Ghosts in Machines!","Selena logged into the local node at 06:58, as she had for the last 2,121 cycles.","Her access credentials passed through the entry filter, which gave no sign of recognition. The frosted glass doors receded, in time with her gait. One of the overhead lights fluttered a moment behind her, then corrected. It was the only noise. The building had been tuned for silence, down to the airflow, which meant the HVAC ran in micro-pulses, inaudible but measurable.","By the time she reached her floor, six transactions had already cleared through her ambient consensus layer. There were two route provisioning checks, one trace reallocation, and three anonymous intent captures. The transactions were bundled, verified, and committed automatically. Selena didn’t notice them, as she received no notification; they were beneath the threshold of volition.","Atop her desk, there was a delicate flower arrangement which changed once a week. The vase looked handmade, as if curated from a nearby artisan. Today it held three flowers: an orange dahlia, a white lisianthus, and a large blade of grass. The rest of the workspace was latent, with no visible interfaces. On the left, a soft rectangle of matte heat accepted her palmprint and heart rate. The screens projected onto her cornea, aligned to her comfort radius with the precision of breath. She sat down, curving naturally into her chair.","Selena was a latency pool manager, mitigating risks between intent registration and transaction finality. She tuned flows. She monitored the orchestration of micro-ledgers as they synced up across the global rail. When intents were registered – when someone paused near a store, hesitated at a turnstile, hovered before an info kiosk – the system spun up smart contracts to match, redirect, and then auction the moment. Most were automatic. A few required values alignment. All required latency optimization. “Seamless Experience” was the job.","At 09:30 she received a notification from Sister Mina, the nickname for the autonomous System Admin. Others called them Control, although it carried a slight negative connotation in that context. A contract had frozen mid-auction. An outdated location oracle fed mismatched route data into a freight intent stack, creating a split-state error. It had been flagged for human review, which was rare. She read through the summary. Nothing visibly wrong. But the contract had rerouted a small flow of foot traffic toward a park. The drone footage showed the crowd dispersing, realizing the network’s intent misalignment.","Selena followed the review protocol. The soft-freeze was followed by a judgement analysis and then uploaded to audit. The oracle service provider was removed from all following auctions until arbitration was completed. Public infrastructure penalties were immediate and severe. Her eyes never left the center of the display.","Silvester was already home when she returned in the afternoon. He was making something with lentils. They kissed – lips barely brushed – and she moved through the hallway as routine. His clothes had no smell. He was wearing a fabric that had once been sold as thoughtful.","She said, “Yeah, the system lagged around midday but nothing queued.”","He nodded lightly. “Cup of tea?”","They stopped trading work stories years ago. Not from boredom or bitterness, just the sense that everything had already been said, and remembered.","After dinner, they watched a loop. It was a personalized show, generated with gestures from their preferred demographic set. No plot, just mood. A character arranged boxes. Another cried at a staircase. Selena liked the lighting.","Later, in bed, Silvester touched her back. She arched towards him, consenting.","Selena didn’t notice when her sleep window began drifting. At first it was subtle. She would lie awake longer, or wake without reason. She’d attribute it to seasonal scheduling shifts, solar interference, stray blue-light exposure. She adjusted her hue settings. Her friends joked that it was nominative determinism, or, in other words, the lunar cycle. The drag continued.","During the day, she began to feel hypnotized. Her body ached in strange places. She’d stretch, check her hydration levels, apply her mother’s balm, re-align her desk settings.","On the feed, other pool managers shared similar symptoms. They used words like slip . Some speculated that it was the rail harmonics; others blamed diet changes. A few suggested it was screen time. Selena scrolled through the replies; never posted. She read the threads with a kind of dissociated familiarity, like listening to strangers at a restaurant saying something she once thought.","One spring morning, as she walked the access corridor to her building, Selena noticed dew glistening on the grass beside the path. Each blade was tipped with a droplet of water.","She paused. Her eyes traced a triangular pattern across three droplets. She stood still. For a breath. For two. It smelled like bicycles and childhood and wet pavement; play.","Her eyes looked over at the wooden bench and then resumed her walk. Logged in at 06:59. She thought to herself, Silvester would have liked the bench.","Selena met her old manager, Clare, for coffee in a public observatory node. They hadn’t seen each other in over a year. Clare looked mostly the same, except somehow thinner, a bit gaunt. Her gestures had collapsed into iconography – smile, nod, tilt. The effect was uncanny, and Selena had slight trouble maintaining casual eye contact.","Clare asked how Selena was holding up.","Selena’s pupils were dilated but unfocused. “How long does it last?”, she asked.","Clare looked at her and smiled, kindly. “You’ll phase soon. Everyone does.”","They watched the slow arc of the city routing lattice update across the horizon. Pulses flickered in the distance – routing rerenders, predictive overlays, ambient pings. Everything adapting to everything else.","Clare said, “They’ve started experimenting with pre-consensual prediction layers now. Transactions would be auctioned even before intent.”","Selena nodded. She had reviewed that proposal at some point, and provided some comments. Or was it a different proposal?, she thought. She asked Clare if the announcement was from marketing or engineering.","Selena stayed at the meeting hub, watching the lattice dissolve into an overcast sky. She could feel her own data emissions, the shape of her movements being auctioned continuously.","At home, Silvester had left a note on her feed: “Hey, remember that book you liked about the time travelers? You were right. It’s slow but good.”","Somewhat appreciative, but unsure of the reference, she mirrored his tone in the response. “Nice. Let me know what you think.”","During the next audit cycle, Selena was asked to assess a failed intent alignment near a refugee housing unit. A distribution contract had apparently diverted basic aid away from a temporary distribution center. People had waited for hours before realizing nothing would arrive.","Selena opened the logs. She found the decision stack and skimmed it. The logic seemed clean. The latency pool had prioritized long-term migration stabilization metrics.","She approved it retroactively, as usual; the contracts were almost always right.","She sat motionless for a while. Then got up and walked to the bathroom. She stood in front of the mirror longer than usual. Not out of vanity. Just to see if anything had shifted. Her skin looked even. Like someone who had never been cut. It occurred to her that nothing had happened for a long time. Her hand tensed slightly as she reached for the soap dispenser.","At some point Silvester began spending more evenings at the local maker space. He was restoring analogs. He would mention textures and the feeling of using the hand tools. He invited her once. She said she had a backlog and wondered if the maker space had an active auction account.","When he returned, he would sit next to her on the couch, smelling faintly of sawdust and rust. She would lean into him briefly, calibrating the scent.","He said one night, “I think we’re doing okay.”","She said, “Yeah. Definitely okay.”","A few hundred cycles passed. The system updated and Selena adjusted with it. Her face aged slightly. Her posture settled.","At work, junior analysts mimicked her choreography.","She no longer remembered when she last felt something like disagreement.","Some may have confused her alignment with equanimity.","Late at night, she would scan the logs sometimes. Endless columns of intents, auctions, resolutions.","She saw them now as emergent hymns. Not crowds, a choir. Half-decisions. Almost-choices. Together, dancing; she smiled as her muse whispered older words.","The temple bell stops— but the sound keeps coming out of the flowers.","Selena logged into the local node at 06:58."],"tags":["Liked by rafa"]},{"id":10,"title":"Brackish Strategy","subtitle":"Issue #41: Monthly Note on Protocols for Business","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: learnings from the first month of our Special Interest Group on Protocols for Business. From the importance of conflict to ideas from basketball and bear management. Brackish (adjective): a mix of saltwater and freshwater, at once quenching and sapping.","Sodium is a dual-action nutrient. On the one hand you need salts like sodium and potassium to rehydrate effectively. On the other hand, too much salt will pull the water out of cells — and can be deadly.","In 2005, Blue Ocean Strategy hit the shelves of airport bookstores and business schools. Its authors urged firms to escape cutthroat “red oceans” by creating new, uncontested markets.","If there was ever a sign that conflict-avoidant tendencies had saturated the minds of managers, that was it. An executive who fears clashes with competitors is like an ultramarathon runner who’s scared of his salt. Trade-offs, arguments, competition, and tensions are necessary parts of corporate life.","In other words, there are no blue oceans. Only blue kiddie pools.","Last month, Summer of Protocols kicked off three special interest groups (SIGs) – one on memory, one on formal theories, and one on protocols for business (P4B). I host the SIGP4B call every other Monday, which you can join on Discord .","This group studies a few overarching questions: How do businesses use protocols? Could they use them better? What can we gain by seeing an organization as a series of protocols?","Simple, but not simplistic questions. The impetus for this group was an ongoing thread of research in protocol studies called tensions , which we define as a trade-off plus a conflict . Businesses not only make constant trade-offs between things like efficiency and thoroughness; they also navigate conflicts that stem from those trade-offs — internally, with partners, between teams, and among stakeholders.","Protocols are a tool to manage tensions between different individuals, teams, or groups. Safety protocols balance security and productivity. Data management protocols negotiate different preferences for privacy and freedom. Meeting protocols, like Robert’s Rules of Order, govern the flow of information between decision makers through a cascade of debates and agreements.","What are the patterns that make these protocols so effective?","So far, we’ve spotted a few promising threads.","First and foremost, it’s clear that using protocols effectively will require a brackish strategy that straddles worlds of peacemaking (freshwater) and of bloody competition (saltwater). A kind of strategic field guide that helps professionals build the capacity to be both streetfighters and diplomats, to be both engineers and marketers, rather than shying away from one dimension of the job.","“Protocols are neither state nor market, but essential to both.” - David Lang, Standards Make the World","We’ll also continue to study the idea of tensions. Many folks have already made inroads to this idea-space under different names: paradox, polarity, both/and thinking, ambidexterity, wicked problem, parallax. We hope not to replace that work but rather to work towards a complementary, empirical study of these phenomena.","And who do I mean by we ? The SIGP4B is a seriously diverse group of professionals, whose jobs include video game design, consulting, construction management, DAO stewardship, constitution-writing, engineering, occupational health, and economic theory.","Below are some case studies we’ve discussed and some more ideas that have cropped up along the way.","The canonical Jobs-Sculley split is usually told as a melodrama of personalities. Jobs was a young, insurgent creative. Sculley was a disciplined moneymaker. After the Apple board allowed that creative tension to escalate into a brutal ultimatum (“It’s me or him”), they exiled Jobs.","A costly period of calm followed as the dominance of the Apple II product line pushed the company’s innovative streak, and therefore its long-term prospects, to the periphery.","We started with this case study because it eventually ended happily. Apple resurrected itself through a deliberate orchestration of conflict . Aesthetics and performance were revitalized in concert with supply chain discipline. Jobs returned, shaking things up, and Tim Cook crushed unit costs.","What the Apple board originally did wrong they eventually did right. At first they sought to give Jobs and Sculley each their own uncontested space — product and operations, respectively. It worked out better when they surfaced the productive fight within the firm and redirected it toward a compounding advantage.","A recent ethnographic study of Lloyd’s of London’s reinsurance market demonstrates how even century-old institutions can convert endemic tensions into a stable engine of collective performance.","Smets, Jarzabkowski, Burke, and Spee identify three micro-level balancing mechanisms: segmenting, bridging, and demarcating. Through those, underwriters shuttle between a communal “subscription” ethos and firm-specific profit imperatives.","Segmenting spatially decouples practices: actuarial modelling occurs in private offices, while reciprocal horse-trading is confined to the public “box.”","Bridging selectively carries information or favours across that divide, releasing complementarities without erasing boundary distinctions.","Demarcating reinscribes limits via peer ridicule, risk-review rituals, or self-monitoring to prevent drift toward either pure communalism or unbridled market opportunism.","The cyclical interplay of these mechanisms sustains what the authors term a “conflicting-yet-complementary” equilibrium — practices anchored in one logic augment, rather than dilute, the value generated under the other￼.","Frank Chimero’s parable of the wolves and the bears is evergreen. You can solve problems or you can manage them.","Some designers prefer solutions — like those who crafted the policy of wolf extermination that led to a trophic cascade in Yellowstone. Like Jobs, those wolves were eventually reintroduced.","Some designers prefer to manage problems. Our protocols at national parks are made to reduce bear-human interactions, without reducing the population of either party.","The logic of Only Openings is like a strange variant of chess where there are no endgames. We play only in a perpetual middlegame. As it happens, one reigning operating principle for middlegame play in chess is to keep the tension . It’s mathematically easier to build an advantageous position when there are more pieces on the board — the web of their potential interactions is the raw material of your strategy.","Chess is not life, but the parallel is too rich to dismiss. Organizations are also stuck in a perpetual middlegame — what many refer to as an infinite game . Teams within an organization operate with conflicting logics (the shrewd accountants versus the eclectic marketers). Organizations, from businesses to governments, profit by keeping healthy diplomatic channels open. You win by keeping the game — and all of its bloody conflicts — going, not by winning the game.","Zone defense was illegal in the NBA until the 2001–2002 season, despite its effectiveness. Why? Spectators hated it .","Tension triads between basketball spectators, players, and managers are a rich case study. Furthermore, zone defense itself might be a profitable lens through which we can reexamine our organizations.","The Anna Karenina Principle , distilled from this (translated) Tolstoy quote — “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” — states that a deficiency in any one of a number of factors dooms an endeavor to failure. Consequently, a successful endeavor is one for which every possible deficiency has been avoided.","When we imagine an organization as a field of tensions, it resembles an enormous team playing zone defense. Each division is responsible for guarding against a particular problem: bankruptcy, loss of trust, indemnity, irrelevance, stagnation, low morale, fraud, workplace accidents, declining market share, etc. This analogy is a good first step toward a useful protocol-based org chart","Subject to the Anna Karenina Principle, any successful business is one where major internal and external tensions are adequately managed. A healthy organization is brackish by nature — full of conflict, but also optionality and potential.","There are three ways to catch this rising tide.","Some of the research and lessons from SIGP4B will be taught in a module of the Protocol School this fall. Get some skills, knowledge, and a certification that will set you apart. Applications close August 22.","The Special Interest Group on Protocols for Business meets every other Monday to discuss tensions, trade-offs, protocol design, and more. Want to approach your business problems from a fresh angle? Drop in next week via the Summer of Protocols Discord or participate asynchronously in the #🧲-protocols-for-business channel.","Request or attend a corporate workshop or seminar on protocols.","Today’s protocol town hall with engineer, analyst, and artist Cory Levinson was live-streamed on our YouTube channel and here on Substack. Missed the stream? Here’s your catch-up.","”A lot has changed in the world of climate protocols over the past few years. In 2023, when I last presented a talk on the current state of affairs to the SoP community, the worlds of DeFi and traditional carbon markets had recently fully collided , with questionable results leaving both sides of the table trying to pick up the pieces in the years to follow. Regen Network , where I was working at the time, had been broadening focus out of carbon and into other environmental markets such as biodiversity crediting - an area that has seen strong engagement from both UNDP and UN Environment Programme with initiatives like the Biodiversity Crediting Alliance . Meanwhile, traditional carbon markets (consisting mostly of reforestation and avoided deforestation credits) continued to face strong headwinds, both from a plummeting in corporate demand after the Guardian’s exposé in early 2023, as well as continued slow progress on instrumentalizing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement — a key piece of international climate protocol puzzle that aims to clarify how voluntary carbon market credits will be treated in the context of jurisdictional national climate commitments.","As a response to this crisis, a small corner of the carbon markets has been gaining traction in both the regulatory and corporate sustainability worlds – that of “durable carbon-dioxide removal”. In many ways this renewed focus on more permanent carbon removal and storage technologies (often abbreviated CDR), is an attempted rebranding of carbon markets – away from greenwashing and questionable “counterfactual claims” of avoidance based credits, and towards scientifically verifiable removals with storage guarantees on the scale of 100s to 1000s of years. Books like the CDR Primer do a great job of laying out the complexity of this landscape. Academic researchers and climate startups today are racing to explore these emerging technologies and pathways – each leveraging different mechanisms for CO2 sequestration, whether engineered or natural, biological or geochemical. Protocols, both as a market standardization mechanism or as a means for accelerating scientific understanding of specific CDR pathways, already seem to have a front seat at the show. During our hour together on Wednesday, we’ll dig into the many different pathways being explored for durable CDR, unpack the current state of play, and look at a few specific points of leverage where protocol thinking can help the CDR industry reach the “gigaton scale” that many hope to see in the coming decades.”"],"tags":[]},{"id":11,"title":"Strange New Rules","subtitle":"Issue #1: A new magazine of stories, studies, and science","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: (Re)launch notes, Chiang’s Law, Chosen Ones, Great Men vs. Great Bureaucrats, Straussian Romantasy and Idiot Theories, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords, protocolization debt, Whitehead advances, worlds and rules, protocol fiction workshop in Austin.","Today, we’re launching a new magazine on Substack, Protocolized , devoted to fiction, case studies, and nonfiction research essays about protocols. Hence our new tagline: stories, studies, science.","Strictly speaking, this is a reboot and migration to Substack. For the past two years, this has been a utilitarian news updates and events email list for the Summer of Protocols program. While we’ll continue to cover those core program-related beats, we feel we’re now ready to level up. The main act, going forward will be magazine-style feature content. If the themes interest you, we invite you to consider submitting a pitch or two. To do this, join our Discord and post a short pitch in the #pitches channel.","We have an ambitious goal: To catalyze a whole global scene around protocols, with a particular focus on a brave new genre of protocol fiction that we think is just itching to emerge, with associated speculation, theorizing, research, and technical / cultural / social analyses. The stories, which we hope you’ll help us tell, are how we envision everything coming together.","We hope to do for protocols what Astounding magazine, one of our inspirations, did for science fiction and technological literacy in its 1940s golden age. Or what the Whole Earth Catalog did for technology-adjacent counterculture in the late 60s and 70s.","This magazine will be the main venue for our scene-making efforts, but we will also be supporting meetups, workshops and such. We’re starting with a protocol fiction workshop next week . If you’re a fiction writer based in Austin, TX, join us!","Readers who have been following the Summer of Protocols program over the last two years need no introduction to the topic, but for those just joining in, you might be wondering: What are protocols, and why are they interesting? And why bother trying to build a techno-cultural scene around them?","Well, we have two years worth of research from the Summer of Protocols you can explore for answers. You can start with the Protocol Reader , a volume of 26 essays and 2 fiction pieces we are releasing today as an ePub . It’s a meaty 300+ page read that we guarantee will protocol-pill you, and change how you view the world forever. Just load it into your reader app or device and dive in. We’ll have you protocol-literate and caught up with our two-year-young conversation in no time. This is an ancient subject, but a young intellectual discipline, so it is surprisingly easy to speedrun your way to the frontier. No special 10x talents or esoteric knowledge necessary. The Protocol Reader is not quite as easy a read as a breezy airport bestseller, but we promise you it is way more rewarding, even if we do say so ourselves.","There is a great deal more material from the program, including dozens of videos from our salons, case-studies about real-world protocols, and a variety of multimedia artifacts – avant garde videos, digital sculptures, and so on. We are working on getting it all better organized and discoverable. But for now, take a run at the Protocol Reader , we promise you won’t regret it.","But we hope all this material will do more than just stimulate and entertain. We hope it will inspire you to begin thinking, researching, writing about, and building protocols yourself, and we hope you’ll pitch us your best ideas to publish in this magazine. We regard our archives from the first two years as a quiet priming of a pump. As we head into the third year of this program, we are going to try and get the pump itself going. And we’ll need your help, because we’re just a bunch of ordinary people trying to make this happen, backed by a small summer research program running on a shoestring budget. 1","With that preamble out of the way, I want to set the tone here, and share a few thoughts we on the editorial team have been discussing as we’ve been planning for this launch.","Our north star for this magazine is something I like to call Chiang’s Law , after the science fiction author Ted Chiang. This law can be stated compactly as: science fiction is about strange rules, while fantasy is about special people.","The statement summarizes a point Chiang has made discursively in various speeches and interviews , in the context of broader discussions of science fiction and fantasy. According to Chiang, science fiction is the literature of change, while fantasy is the literature of changelessness. Science fiction is the process of figuring out how the machine works, even as we work to evolve it, and evolve with it. Fantasy is a pleasant escape into a dream where the universe sees you specifically, and recognizes your specialness. And you are special because you, and you alone, can restore the world to some changeless state of grace it has deviated from.","Whether the story is about spaceships or dragons is irrelevant. If the protagonist is a Chosen One in some sense,﹣someone the universe recognizes individually, and treats as special,﹣you’re dealing with a fantasy story. On the other hand, if the protagonist deals with rules that might perhaps be strange, but apply to everyone in the fictional universe, you’ve got yourself a science fiction story.","The reason science fiction is more strongly associated with technology is that technology tends to harness natural phenomena in new ways and throw us all unceremoniously into alien regimes, with no possibility of restoration of old states. Regimes that require us to invent strange new rules to survive. But also rules that apply to everybody equally. Rules that do not pick out anyone as special.","Chiang’s Law is a revealing lens on the modern world.","For example, Silicon Valley technology discourses, which you’d think ought to follow science fiction rules, actually tend to follow fantasy rules, focused on “Great Men” or “10x programmers,” who are Chosen Ones destined to restore some sort of glorious past of flourishing innovation. Though Silicon Valley technology discourses are focused more on the future than the past, and concerned with semiconductors more than dragons, they have more in common with Lord of the Rings than Foundation.","Similarly, socialist discourses, which you’d think would be about ordinary people, often end up being about purity-tested special people led by Great Bureaucrats who are the purest of them all, and get to define purity for others.","All this is, of course, part of a broader reactionary turn in the global zeitgeist. As Chiang-Law-certified science fiction author David Brin noted over a decade ago , our favorite cliche is a “world full of idiots” that perennially needs saving by Chosen Ones of one sort or the other.","Unfortunately, valorizing traditional bureaucrats as selfless, public-spirited citizens who treat the average human better than mythic heroes do is equally misguided. It merely replaces an on-the-nose and in-your-face special person, the Great Man (it is nearly always a Great Man, and these days, often a Great Billionaire as well), with a more subtle and retiring one, the Great Bureaucrat (a less gendered, but equally “special person” stereotype). Instead of specialness being validated by the act of drawing a metaphoric sword out of a stone, it gets underwritten by mythic institutional careers and sacralized educational pedigrees.","Both regular dragon-slaying heroes, and what are sometimes called bureaucratic heroes , treat the average person as an idiot. Just in different ways. Great Men and Great Bureaucrats are just two sides of the Chosen One coin. Both claim and exercise authority in ways that ordinary people are deemed incapable of meaningfully claiming and exercising.","This is not a new observation. Over a century ago, Vilfredo Pareto, building on Machiavelli’s earlier theories, proposed that power tends to cycle between two kinds of elites, which he dubbed lions and foxes. Lion elites and fox elites map precisely to what I’ve been calling Great Men and Great Bureaucrats.  Neither is a friend to the ordinary individual, but both strenuously claim to be.","But sometimes, when the world is changing radically thanks to technology introducing strange new phenomena into it, the circulation of elites can turn turbulent and unstable, resulting in an unusual degree of intra-elite conflict, Chosen One vs. Chosen One. Great Men vs. Great Bureaucrats.","Such fractious eras can be terrible to live through, as we are all finding out now, but they do have a silver lining: They create an opening for the ordinary individual to gain agency at the expense of both kinds of elites. For the Unchosen Ones to make some real gains.","These gains typically take a very particular form: better protocols.","Real-life, self-styled Great Man types typically treat supporters as mindlessly loyal, enthralled sycophants, and detractors as equally mindless hostile zombies to be contained and stripped of all agency with extreme prejudice, often through direct coercive violence and intimidation.","The typical real-life Great Bureaucrat is not much better: All ordinary people are to be treated with apathy and indifference from the security of institutional fortresses, and stripped of agency using inscrutable and byzantine governance mechanisms. Here too, there is often violence, though often of a disguised and indirect variety, involving what Nadia Asparouhova has dubbed Kafka protocols .","Both Great Bureaucrat and Great Man archetypes of heroism are arguably products of pure fantasy and myth-making. Both are founded on the idea of Special People who must be allowed to exercise unaccountable forms of authority because they have been recognized and chosen by the universe in some way, to exercise authority over the rest of us, who have not been so blessed.","And enough people believe in both varieties of Special People that we find ourselves caught between knee-jerk defenses of sclerotic institutions and mindless attacks on them.","Our narratives tend to focus exclusively on the superficial deportments of Special People — the retreating self-effacement of the sophisticated Great Bureaucrat vs. the charismatic theatrics of the populist Great Man. But the shared epistemic commitment to Greatness as an explanatory model goes largely unchallenged. We are so busy fighting over the relative merits of Pareto Lions and Pareto Foxes, and accusing each other of elitism, we forget to question the shared premises of all elitism.","The title of a classic conservative political text, Thomas Sowell’s The Vision of the Anointed: Self-congratulation as a basis for policy, today describes the political postures of Great Bureaucrats and Great Men alike. We tend to compare and contrast visions, but ignore the arbitrary processes of anointment and self-congratulation that underwrite them, and the resulting capture of agency from un-anointed commoners.","And so we find ourselves in a world trapped between the Scylla and Charybdis of mindlessly defended decaying public institutions that need re-imagining and malicious actors claiming mythic authority trying to capture or vandalize them.","The reasons for this turn towards unbridled fantasy across the elite spectrum are, of course, obvious. We live in a world of Industrial Era institutions that need reimagining, and patient, public-spirited rebuilding in light of rapidly emerging wild technological capabilities. We also live in a world that is several decades into an equally sclerotic Industrial Era theology of free markets that need reimagining.","If you lack the patience and pluralist public-spiritedness required to figure out and operate by strange new laws, the “world full of idiots” narrative is very attractive. So long as you and your Chosen One can convince yourselves of three things. That all the idiots are on the other side. That Great Regulations or Great Accelerations are the answer. And that turning the answer into reality merely requires eliminating hostile idiots from positions of power.","And so we find ourselves hopeless, trapped in a world framed by narratives of stasis (and most visions of “acceleration,” rather ironically, tend to fetishize a kind of historicist process stasis) rather than one being powerfully molded and reoriented by actual ongoing changes in the environment.","A world lacking a true literature of change in Chiang’s terms, and resigned to fighting over competing theories of elite-led changelessness.","We here at Protocolized believe there is a way out of this bind: better protocols!","A world that needs Great Men or Great Bureaucrats to keep rescuing it through heroic deeds, usually deeds of restoration, is necessarily a world that treats its average member like an idiot.","The Great Bureaucrat hopes to restore a New Normalcy through Great Regulations. The Great Man hopes to restore capital-P Progress through a Great Acceleration. Both treat the vast majority of humans as non-special idiots to be contained.","This ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy, when it comes to building technological systems. Systems built upon the principle that the average person is an idiot will in fact reduce the average person to an idiot, regardless of their actual abilities. And even if such functional idiots aren’t actual idiots, and even if unironic worship of mythologies of Greatness is restricted to clueless minorities within each tribe, the effect is the same. As Slavoj Žižek has pointed out , cynicism by itself is not sufficient to resist a world ruled by Chosen One fantasies. Given a strong enough Idiot Theory driving governance, the difference between cynicism and surrender becomes irrelevant, and pretense of consent by the governed is as good as sincere consent.","Both the Great Man theory of change and Great Bureaucrat theories of governance are functionally equivalent to Idiot Theories of the general population. In fact, the two theories usually harmonize so well that they are indistinguishable in their treatment of ordinary people.","The current war among elites starkly reveals the extent to which neither philosophy centers on the interests of ordinary people.","Both theories fit the Chiang’s Law understanding of fantasy: a world with special rules for special people, and idiot rules for the rest of us. That different groups are “special” under the two schemes is a distinction without a difference for the rest of us. Does it really matter whether a long-term career bureaucrat or a billionaire treats you like an idiot, good only for exercising agency conditioned on unquestioning loyalty? Do you care which specific purity test screens you out for thinking for yourself?","Political philosophies based on two such sets of rules — one for trustworthy anointed elites, one for everyone else — are sometimes called Straussian, after the conservative philosopher Leo Strauss. Straussian philosophies formally justify making a distinction between Great Men (or Great Bureaucrats), to whom special rules (or no rules) apply, and ordinary people, who can be justifiably treated like idiots.","Straussian philosophies are often assumed to be right-coded, but the underlying paternalism can be found both on the Right and Left, and in nominally libertarian polities as well as authoritarian ones. Straussian attitudes can be found in billionaire war-rooms, bureaucratic committee meetings, powerful old media newsrooms, and exclusive academic conclaves for gray eminences. People who imagine themselves to be special, and justified in telling noble lies to the rest of the world, can be found just about everywhere.","But unlike the world of just a few decades ago, the world of 2025 is not governed by dry and analytic Straussian political philosophies as such, but by Straussian romantasies. Paired narratives of mythic proportions unfolding in parallel in lay public and elite private discourses (or what Straussians refer to as exoteric and esoteric discourses). They are not romantasies of the ogre-meets-princess Shrek variety of course. They are higher-order romantasies; Straussian Strum und Drang grand narratives fueled by the sublime sentimental tendencies of Chosen Ones.","Romantasy (a portmanteau of romance and fantasy ) is apparently the fastest growing category of genre fiction, and if you squint a bit, the governing narratives of our world fit the genre well. Science fiction proper, in the Chiang’s Law sense, is in retreat.","We are escaping not to truly different strange new worlds, but to worlds that depressingly mirror our own, built around caricatures of special people. The only difference is that romantasies reliably cater to specific narcissistic conceits, preferred Chosen Idols, and parasocial tendencies, in ways the real world does not.","Arguably this shift from dry ideology and philosophy to soaring romantasy has a very particular historical cause: An accumulation of unprotocolized technological evolution awaiting processing.","Between the death of Leo Strauss in 1973, and 2025, our world has been utterly transformed by wave after wave of new technologies, harnessing a growing range of natural phenomena, each governed by strange new natural laws that require strange new artificial rules to harness. Strange new rules that must be mastered through effort. Rules that induce strange new world geometries to which there are no royal roads.","We have fallen way behind on the task of creating new kinds of order out of all this rich and wild new technological phenomenology. We are groaning under a vast amount of protocolization debt.","An idea we quote often in the Summer of Protocols is relevant here: Alfred North Whitehead’s observation that “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”","In our fledgling research community, we refer to achieving “Whitehead advances” as the core work of protocolization. These are not Great Leaps (or Great Regulations or Great Accelerations) that precipitate utopian end-states overnight. Rather, they are humble and concrete behavior changes that diffuse slowly through the population, as we all learn to live by new rules en masse . Rules like washing hands with soap before doing surgeries. Or following traffic signals. Or learning new opsec rules concerning encrypted communications and private keys.","So one way to understand protocolization debt is Whitehead advances waiting to happen.","Nature, as the saying goes, abhors a vacuum. So in the absence of Whitehead advances, hordes of self-styled Chosen Ones across the world have rushed in to colonize the wild new technologically generated territories.","There is an interesting mental model we can employ here: that of pioneer species . Pioneer species are plant species that are very quick and aggressive in colonizing unoccupied new territories (such as those created by clear-cutting or forest fires). From a human point-of-view, pioneer species are often nuisance species or weeds.","But they do have an important role to play, since they pave the way for more robust colonization by slower, but richer ecologies, via a process known as primary succession .","So, even though it is an unflattering metaphor, the idea of pioneer species affords us a useful perspective on Chosen Ones and the Straussian romantasies that fuel their behaviors. Despite their tendency to make invasive nuisances of themselves, and their relentless efforts to capture and hold on to power, during periods of rapid change and accumulating protocolization debt, they do have an important role to play.","But if pioneer species establish too strong an early dominance, and become too hard to displace, the entire ecology collapses.","If, however, a healthy process of primary succession kicks in, the wilderness gets slowly tamed by a series of Whitehead advances. The strange new environment gets protocolized. Strange new rules appear, causing the Chosen Ones to retreat and allowing ordinary people to acquire new literacies, make new gains, and enjoy a better world.","Perhaps the best illustration of Chiang’s Law and the science fiction/fantasy distinction is Star Trek vs. Star Wars. While there is a lot to dislike about the politics of Star Trek﹣ it is a militarized, casteist, rigid social-democratic bureaucracy managed by percentages, spreadsheets, and arbitrary conventions﹣it is definitely a world where rules rather than people, are special. In some ways, the Prime Directive is the star of the show, and the grand narrative is about figuring out how to apply it, and when and where to make exceptions systematically, rather than with sovereign arrogance.","Authority on the command deck goes with whoever is sitting in the captain’s chair, not with the titular captain. And a deep bench of officers is prepared to sit in it. Authority transfer is a routine and unremarkable element in the plots, even on the occasions when young and inexperienced officers find themselves in the captain’s chair.","The trope of the captain’s chair in Star Trek is a fine example of a Whitehead advance displacing a Chosen One cultural pattern. It is a true Round Table, with no King Arthur marked as special by virtue of possession of a mythic sword. A classic Monty Python sketch makes this point:","King Arthur : The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.","Dennis : Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony .","Dennis : You can’t expect to wield supreme executive power just ’cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!","Dennis : I mean, if I went around saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they’d put me away!","Arthur : [grabs Dennis] Shut up! Will you shut up?!","Dennis : Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!","Even Captain Kirk, portrayed as inventive and subversive, usually acts according to protocol. He is often imaginative and creative, but rarely autocratic or arbitrary. In the franchise, Chosen One societies, such as Klingons, Romulans, and Cardassians, and Khan Noonien Singh’s band, are typically antagonists of the Federation. Even the Borg have a queen, and the mercantilist Ferengi a “Grand Nagus.”","The Federation? It has protocols.","The opening voice-over famously includes a phrase that is useful for us: strange new worlds.","Good new protocols enable us to venture into truly strange new worlds, where following the rules is our only hope for staying alive. In the beginning, these strange new worlds may require strange new rules that we can never dismiss from acute consciousness. But over time, they sink into the collective unconscious, as Whitehead advances, and turn into familiar old rules for familiar old worlds, freeing up energy to yet again discover new strange worlds to venture into.","Today, in 2025, we don’t have to venture into outer space to find strange new worlds. We are barreling headlong into strange new regimes of natural laws we thought we understood. The climate is starting to do things so strange, our own planet is starting to seem alien to us. Silicon and copper﹣“rocks we tricked into thinking with lightning”﹣are starting to do such strange things that our own minds are becoming unfamiliar to us. The curious chemical compounds known as GLP-1 agonists are radically rewiring both our fundamental drives and desires, and our loftiest philosophical sensibilities.","This is not a world you can trust to the supposed genius of Great Men or to the supposed enlightenment of Great Bureaucrats.","We are already deep into strange new worlds that require us to formulate and live by strange new rules. Rules that reflect the strange new logics, and apply in the same way to all.","It is time to protocolize!","The Summer of Protocols program is primarily funded by the Ethereum Foundation at a modest level, with some support from a few partner institutions. We use our funds primarily for summer research grants and in-person research events.

RSVP on the Summer of Protocols Discord.","By bridge, we mean both literal bridges and close physical or digital analogues, such as mountain passes, straits, tunnels, technical interconnection mechanisms between computer systems, and human cultural bridging functions such as translation and diplomacy.","In the following sections, we cover: examples of what we mean by bridges , hints on we will look for, suggested background readings and resources, and logistics .","The best way to brainstorm for this contest is to start with a rich set of example “bridges.” We’ve compiled the following list to help you get started:","The literal bridges through history connecting the European and Asian sides of what is now Istanbul.","The Straits of Bosphorus, connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean (and in tension with the bridges across the straits).","Important natural passes, such as the Khyber pass, and straits like Malacca and Gibraltar","Rivers like the Mississippi that serve as important connectors of regions","Logistically important transportation corridors, such as rail, road, and marine routes, and ones of high political and military significance, such as the Bridge of No Return connecting North and South Korea, or the Wagah Border Crossing between India and Pakistan.","Technical bridges, such as the ones allowing transfers of funds between Ethereum L2 chains, the SWIFT system, various gateway protocols, “edge servers” on networks.","Complex physical infrastructures such as locks connecting bodies of water, systems to transfer railway carriages across incompatible gauge networks, intermodal containers, automobile ferries, and systems for connecting electrical grids. Think about unique ones too, such as the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project docking mechanism, the Channel Tunnel (which connects the UK to France, but also a right-hand-drive system to a left-hand-drive system).","Formal “bridge” human roles such as that of the Dragoman in the Ottoman empire, who served as interpreters and guides across Turkish, Arabic, Persian, and European languages, and hawala money changers.","Mediation roles played by religious figures, such as Andrew of Longimieu , a Dominican priest who served as a papal envoy to the Mongol empire","Historically important diplomats, such as von Metternich , Talleyrand , Zhang Qian , Ahmad ibn Fadan , and Megasthenes","Important “track 2” figures, such as travelers/traders like Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta, religious pilgrims like Xuanzang, and missionaries like the Jesuits, all of whom often ended up serving diplomatic and bridge-building functions.","“Conflict” bridges such as the Underground Railroad, blockade-runners in the US Civil War (think Gone With the Wind ), smuggling routes, and tunnels under the Berlin Wall.","Modern professional diplomats, specializing in specific international relations.","Institutional relationship patterns like “sister city” schemes, exchange student programs, and foreign study scholarships, and larger transient events such as World Fairs, the Olympics.","Bottom-up cultural interchange mechanisms such as fusion music and cuisine.","Your story can involve as many or as few of these kinds of bridges as you like, but we recommend incorporating at least ONE technological (either physical or digital) actual bridge-like infrastructural element that plays a non-trivial role in the plot, and ONE human institutional or cultural bridge-like element, such as a diplomat or trader protagonist.","This contest topic is obviously vast and deep, and you can take your ideas in many directions. But here are some things we are looking for.","Tension between formal and informal human mechanisms : Diplomacy often involves a formal level of treaties, demarches, and carefully coded public statements, as well as a more free-form backroom process and “track 2” or side-channel efforts. Those can be in tension.","Displaced conflicts: Particularly in engineering conflicts involving standards and protocols, with billions at stake (think VHS vs. Betamax, USB-C vs. Lightning), seemingly innocuous engineering tradeoff discussions/negotiations turn into undeclared wars beneath superficial peace. You can also see these mechanisms play out in sporting rivalries.","MICE framework : Your story can be in the past or future, but should explore milieus , ideas , characters and events ( MICE , in Orson Scott Card’s scheme) related to bridge-building AND bridge-burning. Both aspects are important — make sure to include a strong element of conflict, such as a brewing or recently concluded war. This can be a literal, bloody, kinetic war, or a bloodless “conceptual” war, such as a technical standards war. Avoid stories that are purely about building bridges. Though those can be exciting, that’s not what we’re looking for in this contest.","Think B-Plot Protagonists : Stories about building/burning bridges often center quiet, obscure “B-plot” figures of history — diplomats, bureaucrats, messengers, priests, traders, smugglers. Lean into this! We specifically do not want stories with “main character energy.” We want “side character energy!”","Liminality x Strange Rules : Bridges are by definition and construction liminal spaces, connecting spaces that are mutually incommensurable in some way, calling for translation.

It introduced me to the story of Faber Birren , responsible for the characteristic color schemes we associate with mid-century industrial interiors. More generally, Birren pioneered the use of color as a design and control variable shaping everything from consumer buying behaviors to emergency response behaviors.","Color is especially interesting as an element of Protocol Experience (PX) design, since humans are especially sensitive to color. And color, especially in the form of paint, is a cheap design variable, ideal for persistent, configurational uses. You don’t need electricity to generate a default color scheme. Ambient broad-spectrum illumination (natural or artificial) is enough. And when you do use powered color for dynamic signaling, it is still robust and inexpensive to generate, especially today, with the rise of low-power LED lighting and screens.","Reading Mathews’ article, as a sometime practicing control engineer, I was struck by the realization that though I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about command and control architectures, systems, and protocols, including control rooms, I’ve never thought about color as a particularly important consideration in control engineering, either in theory, or practice.","I’d never noticed that mid-century control rooms have a characteristic sea-foam green color.","When I’ve designed things like dashboards, color has been an afterthought, and I’ve usually done something lazy like code “significant” as “red.”","Yet, color is obviously one of the most powerful design elements available to control system engineers and protocol architects, especially when it comes to human-in-the-loop environments. But engineers don’t study it. Textbooks don’t teach color science. Even history books like David Mindell’s excellent Between Human and Machine: Feedback, Control, and Computing , don’t cover the role of color in command and control.","One reason of course is that color is not easy to use in automated feedback loops, and other kinds of signals are much easier to work with. Detecting and reacting to color-coded signals typically takes cameras attached to significant computing power. In control design, it is much easier to work with electrical or mechanical signals from more specialized sensors.","But when there are humans in the loop, color is a natural and cheap signaling variable. It still doesn’t play a big role though.","The reason is that the human -centeredness of color leads to its neglect in control engineering. Humans, unlike op-amps or microcontrollers, are flaky, temperamental, and unreliable engineering components. Components of last resort when architecting for reliability.","When humans must be integrated into a protocol that generates reliably repeatable behavior, it takes significant investment in training to get them to behave in sufficiently machinic ways. We had to invent an entire subculture of “professionalism” to teach and sustain reliable human behavior. And even then, color is never just functional for humans. It is invariably also an element of aesthetic experience, psychological comfort, and narrative commitment. In control engineering terms, color is an exceptionally noisy signal when processed by human brains.","So it makes sense that control engineers and protocol architects largely washed their hands of color, and learned to work around it. It became the preserve of designers and psychologists.","The Birren palette was designed to be a functional color-coding language for safety-first interiors, and meant to be comfortable to inhabit for extended working hours. It was the 1950s visual equivalent of elevator music plus the dings/bells/alarm sounds an elevator is capable of producing.","In 2025 though, Birren-colored interiors evoke mid-century nostalgia. The Birren palette has unavoidable aesthetic-narrative connotations today that were likely never intended. It is the palette of Golden Age science fiction. Of Competent Men doing Professional Things.","This is not what industrial interiors of more recent construction look like though (hence the nostalgic appeal of the Birren palette). And it turns out there’s a fascinating story there about how the relationship between color and industrial safety has evolved, which I was able to unpack with help from ChatGPT.","That’s not what I set out to do though. I started out simply wanting to make some nostalgia-aesthetic digital art using the Birren color palette, with a view to possibly training an image model on it with TITLES . Here is my first attempt. I aim to make about 30 such paintings, and then train a model I’ll name Birren. This one is a sort of abstract industrial interior where a Birren-palette foreground partially masks lurking fire risks.","I wanted a stable swatch of colors to make such paintings. So just for fun, and partly to flatter my own conceits about possessing some rusty Color Science 101 knowledge from when I started my first job at Xerox two decades ago, I began by asking ChatGPT to transform the old magazine scan from Mathews’ article into an approximate color-corrected swatch for me to use in my painting program, taking into account the gamut distortions in scanning a faded old magazine article.","Here, if you’re curious, are the palette as shared by Mathews (leftmost) and the one reconstructed by ChatGPT (middle and right).","The practical reasons for doing this are to have a uniform patch of color to sample with the dropper tool in painting programs, and to attempt to undo the color-shifting effects of scanning, printing, and aging in the scan.","As it turns out, Birren color schemes are pretty forgiving. They’re not defined with the precision of Pantone spot colors, but in terms of ranges that respect a particular visual logic and grammar. They are also designed to work within the capabilities of paints available in Birren’s era (the 1950s). For instance, fluoroscent paints, which play a big role today in the color of safety, were not available then.","In the process of making these swatches, thanks to some passing comments by ChatGPT, I discovered that there’s a lot more to the story. The entire philosophy of how to use color as part of a safety strategy has changed. The Birren-style philosophy of safety protocols has been replaced by a different one, best represented in the US by color-coding practices associated with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).","I had ChatGPT explain this evolution to me, and then write an essay summarizing our conversation. The next few sections were primarily written by ChatGPT, with light edits and additions by me. Comments and corrections from better-informed color scientists and industrial interior designers welcome.","Color in industrial and architectural space has never been merely aesthetic. It organizes attention, encodes danger, regulates bodily comfort, and quietly trains perception over time. Yet, contemporary designers rarely get an opportunity to think about these matters. They most often encounter industrial color schemes through regulatory tables and compliance charts – reds, yellows, greens assigned to predefined meanings and applied late in the design process.","This way of thinking about color is historically recent. In the mid-twentieth century, figures such as Faber Birren approached color not as a signaling layer but as a fundamental component of environmental design. The evolution from Birren’s approach to the standardized safety regimes later enforced by OSHA reflects deeper changes in psychology, materials, labor assumptions, and philosophies of risk.","Birren worked at a moment when industrial modernity had reached a form of equilibrium. Factories, offices, schools, and hospitals were places where people expected to spend years, often entire careers. His foundational assumption was that color must support sustained human presence. Color planning, in his view, was neither decorative nor symbolic in isolation. It was infrastructural. Interiors were visual systems whose brightness, contrast, and chromatic intensity had to be regulated as carefully as acoustics or lighting. A well-designed color environment would quietly reduce fatigue, increase accuracy, and make moments of danger perceptually unmistakable without constant visual noise.","Central to Birren’s thinking was the primacy of value , or lightness . He believed that the eye organizes space first by brightness before it attends to hue or saturation. As a result, Birren-style interiors followed a strict value hierarchy. Ceilings were lightest, maximizing reflected light and reducing glare. Walls were slightly darker, providing a calm, continuous field. Floors and machinery occupied middle values that grounded the space visually. Crucially, the most serious hazards and stop conditions were rendered darker still. Fire equipment, for example, was often painted in deep, low-value reds rather than bright scarlets. Darkness carried weight. It signaled seriousness and finality in a way that brightness could not.","This hierarchy was not meant to be consciously decoded. Over time, workers learned it implicitly. The environment trained perception. A glance was enough to tell what mattered, not because the colors were loud, but because they were rare and carefully positioned within an ordered field.","Birren was equally deliberate about chroma. He treated saturation as a physiological variable rather than an expressive one. Large areas of high chroma were avoided because they increased visual fatigue and rapidly lost their signaling power through habituation. Most continuously viewed surfaces were kept at low to moderate chroma, allowing the eye to rest. Higher chroma was permitted only in small, localized areas where interruption was genuinely required. In this sense, Birren’s environments relied on restraint. Color worked because it was not constantly demanding attention.","Neutral grays played an especially important role in this system. Far from being generic leftovers, grays functioned as active regulators of brightness and contrast. They reduced glare from machinery, stabilized visual fields, and framed colored elements so that those elements retained meaning.","Without gray, Birren’s system would collapse. It was the quiet scaffolding that allowed color to function precisely.","Birren’s philosophy was shaped not only by psychology but by material reality. The paints available during his career were chemically and optically limited. Fluorescent pigments did not yet exist, chroma ceilings were lower, and saturation stability over time was imperfect. Color thinking was grounded in reflectance rather than emission. The Munsell color system, with its explicit separation of hue, value, and chroma, aligned naturally with this worldview. Designers thought in terms of perceptual relationships rather than device outputs or symbolic codes. These technical constraints reinforced Birren’s emphasis on value hierarchy and chroma restraint.","By the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, the social and industrial context that supported Birren’s approach began to dissolve. Workforces became more transient, automation increased, and regulatory and legal pressures intensified. Spaces were no longer designed primarily for long-term inhabitation by stable populations. Instead, they had to function for visitors, contractors, inspectors, and emergency responders who might encounter them only briefly and under stress. In this new context, color systems based on gradual perceptual learning appeared inadequate.","Additionally, the rise of automation meant color was no longer as critical, since fewer humans were persistently present in industrial interiors, and automated systems typically used signals other than color to run themselves. The retreat of color foreshadows, in some ways, the modern rise of dark industrial interiors, ranging from dark data centers to metaphorical dark kitchens.","The rise of OSHA-style safety color reflects this shift. Modern safety color treats color not as part of an environmental context but as a discrete and exceptional signaling system. The goal is immediate recognition rather than long-term coherence. Red means fire or stop, yellow means caution, green means safety, and blue means notice. These meanings are fixed, explicit, and standardized across industries. The system assumes distraction, cognitive load, and urgency. It is designed to function even when the surrounding environment is chaotic.","This philosophical shift is visible most clearly in how value is treated. OSHA does not define a value hierarchy. In practice, safety colors are often high in both value and chroma. Bright yellow hazard markings, vivid red fire equipment, and intense green safety signs frequently sit against white or very light walls. Multiple elements compete at similar brightness levels, flattening perceptual ranking. Where Birren used darkness to convey seriousness, OSHA uses brightness to demand attention.","Here is an example of OSHA style colors, in the form of a catalog of safety tapes of various sorts.","The widespread availability of fluorescent pigments intensified this trend. Fluorescent paints emit light as well as reflect it, making them highly visible in poor lighting and at long distances. From a signaling perspective, this is a clear advantage. From an environmental perspective, it is destabilizing. Fluorescent colors dominate surrounding surfaces, erode subtle value relationships, and accelerate visual fatigue. As more signals become bright, designers add still brighter signals, producing a cycle of escalation. The result is environments that are visually loud even when nothing is happening.","At a deeper level, Birren and OSHA embody two distinct theories of safety. Birren’s approach assumes that safety emerges from order. A calm, legible environment makes danger perceptually obvious because danger is rare and visually distinct. OSHA’s approach assumes that danger must be unmistakable even in disorder. Safety is achieved through explicit alarms that override context. One system relies on learned visual grammar; the other relies on categorical symbols.","Birren is about high context environments. OSHA is about verbose signaling environments.","These approaches produce markedly different experiences. Birren-style environments tend to feel coherent and calm, supporting long periods of focused work with relatively low fatigue. They work best where people have time to learn the space and internalize its logic. OSHA-dominant environments, by contrast, are optimized for immediacy. They function well for short-term occupants and emergencies but often produce visual clutter and desensitization over time. When everything is bright and urgent, urgency loses meaning.","Most contemporary industrial and institutional spaces are hybrids of these two systems. Birren-like backgrounds coexist with OSHA-style overlays. The result is often perceptual tension rather than balance. Value hierarchies are partially established and then violated. The eye receives conflicting instructions about what matters. This is why many modern interiors feel subtly exhausting even when they are technically compliant.","For design students, the lesson is not to choose Birren over OSHA or vice versa. The lesson is to recognize that color systems encode assumptions about people, time, risk, and responsibility. Before choosing colors, one must ask whether a space is meant for dwelling or for passage, whether safety is learned or instantaneous, whether fatigue or distraction is the dominant risk. Birren’s approach fails if applied uncritically today, just as OSHA’s approach fails when spread indiscriminately across entire environments.","Color is philosophy made visible. The transition from Birren’s visual ecology to OSHA’s signal saturation mirrors a broader cultural shift from spaces designed for inhabitation to systems designed for risk management. Understanding this history allows designers to use color deliberately rather than inherit it accidentally. The palette is never neutral. It expresses a theory of how people relate to space, danger, and each other.","Thank you ChatGPT, back to me.","The retreat of color that started in the 1970s has now reached its nadir in the form of dark industrial interiors, where visible-spectrum elements are largely irrelevant ( infrared though still matters).","But there’s a counter-trend underway: the rise of AI and robotics have created a strong drive towards camera-based infrastructures, and even camera-only infrastructures. In robotics, for example, one school of thought holds that cameras are all you need . That you can even dispense with things like angle sensors or rotary encoders if you have enough cameras. In the self-driving car industry, Tesla famously holds that lidars (which rely on infrared) are unnecessary. If biological organisms can self-drive using vision alone, so can cars.","Of course, you cannot entirely eliminate all other sensors. Sound is clearly almost as important as vision even for us highly visual primates. And all mammals have the equivalent of accelerometers in their ears. So it is no surprise that phones and robots typically feature microphones and accelerometers as well. But, to a first approximation, cameras are eating the world’s sensors, and will demand a return to a more colorful world.","Cameras are surprisingly powerful sensors because almost everything that might matter for feedback in a controlled environment either has a natural visual component, or can be rendered visible at low cost (for example, introducing a colorant in invisible dangerous gases or clear liquids). Just as the smartphone has replaced many personal devices, the camera can replace dozens of different sensors.","The cost though, is the need for intelligence. You need an AI, or ideally, a robot to interpret and react to color (and visual fields in general).","And when color communicates safety, and is linked to behaviors that must unfold extremely rapidly, you have a major challenge for future designers and architects.","What should the color of safety be in the age of AI? How will be paint industrial interiors when the primary inhabitants are camera-driven intelligent machines, ranging from robots to appliance-like machines, to background smart-environment features?","The designer – or AI – who figures out the answers will enter the history books alongside Birren and his late-industrial successors.","Since the color of safety is rarely fully visible unless there is an active emergency unfolding, and because industrial interiors are not particularly accessible anyway, it is not an easy observation target for protocol watching 1 enthusiasts.","Fortunately, it also happens to be a favored topic in screen media. It is fascinating to pay attention to the color of safety in movies and television, especially over time (obviously, this is only possible past the black and white era).","The wave of disaster movies from the early 1970s, including such cult classics as The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure, showcase Birren-like safety environments at their peak. The build-up of tension has an uneasy background-dominant vibe of terror to it. The characters seem to inhabit their environments much more mindfully. Plots seem much more atmospheric and suspenseful.","By contrast, modern disaster thrillers are much more likely to feature bright flashing lights and loud alarms – and characters who don’t really attend to their environments until things start going wrong. Thrilling foreground excitement tends to replace ominous background build-up of terror. Plots are action-packed rather than suspenseful.","As storytellers adapt to the age of AI, we can expect to see the color of safety reshape human narratives yet again. And us protocol-watchers will have a whole new crop of movies and TV shows to watch, and a new color-of-safety language to decipher.","Protocol Watching is a hobby we are trying to foster here at Protocolized.

Out of sight of its delighted passengers, curious practices arnd economies develop around this journey, and remain hidden until an inquisitive device comes along. Plus, last call to apply for the AI Futurama workshop happening next week in Berlin.","The UET-1 stretched nearly a kilometer from nose to tail, its segmented body gleaming under station lights, each car bearing different national and corporate insignia that blurred together as it moved – Chinese characters giving way to Cyrillic lettering, then Latin script, then back again. Steel wheels groaned beneath 4000 tonnes of contradictions – open borders and security checkpoints, welcome mats and retinal scanners – as they rolled across invisible lines drawn by treaties.","The mechanical serpent had been conceived by committees that met in Brussels, Beijing, and a dozen other capitals, each leaving its fingerprints on contradictory clauses and redundant appendices. At the borderlands where empires had once declared their mistrust in millimetres, its wheels were drawn apart or squeezed together, each bogie lifted on hydraulic frames while inspectors looked on with the solemnity of priests at a baptism. At the junctions where power lines altered their temperament, the pantograph dipped, rose again, and found another current – 3000 volts of direct current in one sector, 15,000 alternating in the next, 25,000 in the one beyond, the same wire conducting a dozen different languages of electricity. And in those neglected stretches where wires had never been strung at all – 100 kilometres of steppe here, 50 through jungle there – the train relied on the old compromise, a diesel generator buried in its belly, awakening like a tired, grumbling ox until the catenary reappeared.","Inside, passengers spoke of the train as if it were a hotel with unusually long corridors. There were compartments with padded seats, and dining cars with menus in four languages. Tickets promised seamless travel from Lisbon to Singapore, and some oblivious passengers believed it. They saw uniformed attendants, customs officials who came and went with stamps and scanners, inspectors who whispered in many tongues, and assumed the machine was as simple as the image it projected.","Outside, where the light fell on sidings and forgotten platforms, another population watched the UET-1 pass. Those without tickets – refugees, smugglers, fugitives, nobody’s children – studied the train not for its comfort but for its cracks. To them it was a portal that tempted from a distance – a threshold between worlds that slid tantalizingly past, its windows like keyholes to lives they could glimpse but never enter. They traced its path in chalk signs, in murmured warnings passed from campfire to campfire, in symbols etched where no inspector thought to look. They knew that a train so grand must also have blind spots, and they lived in the hope of slipping through them.","And then there were those who stood between: the railway police, the inspectors in small border towns, whose job it was to keep the fiction intact. They were seldom thanked and rarely noticed, these railway police, and perhaps it was better that way, for their work was to be shadows in the margins. If the passengers thought of them at all, it was only with unease, for the sight of a railway policeman in a carriage corridor meant that the smooth fiction had been broken.","There was Inspector Dobrov, who had perfected the art of waiting in the Irkutsk control room, staring at banks of screens with such patience that colleagues forgot he was present. In Perm, Officer Shishkin paced the edge of the track with the nervous gait of a man half-convinced the facial-recognition system would misidentify him one day. Sergeant Kalin in Omsk carried, in his breast pocket, a collection of confiscated buttons, coins, and fragments of paper that together told the story of people none of the passengers had seen; he called it his museum of the margins, though no one ever asked to visit.","It was a world of margins – of treaties signed but not obeyed, of passengers who belonged and those who did not, of officers who dreamed of boredom and received paperwork instead. It was in this world, where the rails of empire met the cracks of human life, that Detective Pavel Murkin found himself, one fog-soaked morning, assigned a device he did not want, to solve a case that had never quite been closed.","Murkin had spent his entire professional life in a protracted negotiation with the universe over what was an acceptable amount of bother. Some men sought glory, others riches, others the handshakes of ministers and the approving nods of generals. Murkin, by contrast, sought only a modest daily ration of boredom, the kind that could be supplied by a confiscated ham sandwich, and perhaps a scuffle between ticket inspectors lubricated by contraband vodka.","That was why, when given the chance, he had selected the Railway Police post at the Russian border junction on the UET-1 corridor – a place so far removed from the intrigues of the capital that even rumours arrived there already exhausted.","But fate, with its ways of sniffing out men who wish only to be left alone, had other plans. One dreary Monday, when the fog rolled in from the east and settled in the plains, Murkin was volunteered – a verb in the bureaucratic dialect which means “conscripted under the guise of favour” – to trial a new contraption issued from somewhere well above his pay grade.","The device was called the Pono. Its name, chosen by committee in a building far away, was meant to suggest uprightness, balance, and a general improvement in human affairs. In practice it resembled a cross between a pocket-watch, a dictaphone, and an unusually surly monocle. The Pono listened, it recorded, it catalogued, and – so its pamphlet proclaimed – it partnered with the officer in the eternal struggle against the general untidiness of mankind.","Murkin regarded it much as a cat regards a bath: with suspicion, resignation, and the quiet certainty that indignity would follow. For the Pono, though technically still in trial deployment, behaved with the confidence of an institution already fully entrenched. It reminded him of forgotten case numbers from 2018. It recalled the exact sequence of remarks he had made to a customs officer in Minsk three years earlier and suggested he might wish to “revise his tone” in future.","And so Murkin’s cherished life of minor inconveniences was replaced by a daily ordeal of relentless recollection, administered by a machine that treated memory like a blunt instrument. If the ordinary duties of railway policing had once been about keeping the train moving forward, the duties of a Pono-equipped officer seemed more concerned with keeping the past moving forward – dragging every forgotten case and every missing bolt back into the present with the persistence of a tax collector.","It was, Murkin reflected darkly, the exact opposite of what he had hoped for when he accepted this post at the edge of things. He had wanted cases to dissolve into the fog of bureaucratic amnesia, leaving him free to retreat into his private kingdom of crossword puzzles and daydreams. Instead, this infernal machine had made a religion of remembrance, with Murkin as its reluctant altar boy.","When at last Murkin tired of arguing with the Pono – for it was quite capable of sustaining an argument unaided, continually reintroducing points one thought conclusively settled – he discovered that it came furnished with a function described in the manual as “archival browsing.” This, the document assured him, would allow the officer to “engage proactively with unsolved or dormant cases of potential future relevance,” which in plain Russian meant “dig about in dusty cupboards at your own peril.”","Murkin had no intention of engaging proactively with anything. But the day was long, and the fog persisted. So, with the air of a man turning over an old shoe to see whether it contained anything edible, he instructed the Pono to open the archives.","At once the little machine sprang to life – not with any actual sound (it operated in that eerie silence common to all modern devices), but in Murkin’s mind it cleared its throat like a self-satisfied bureaucrat about to unveil some long-forgotten transgression. Case after case paraded before him. The archive was less an index of crimes than a cemetery of half-forgotten bureaucratic disappointments: a missing shipment of H100 silicon chips, an unresolved quarrel over carriage upholstery, a suspicious samovar fire in 2017.","And then, lodged among the trivialities, appeared a name.","The entry was sparse: Occupation: Border runner. Duty: Verification of tickets in disputed jurisdictions. Status: Missing. Last input: “Fog, Irkutsk sector.” Remarks: Inconclusive.","Murkin frowned. A border runner. He had heard of them in training – men and women employed to patrol those sections of the railway where no single authority reigned, where maps were conjecture and laws contradicted one another. Their work was to keep together the fiction that the train was always properly in one place or another, never in the margins between. They were, in their way, practitioners of a kind of legal kintsugi : mending cracks in sovereignty with whatever filings and stamps were at hand, awkwardly stitching together rules where none had existed, so that the line of travel might look unbroken even as it passed over fractures no one wished to acknowledge.","Stepan had vanished long ago, but the record was stubbornly incomplete, neither closed nor pursued. The Pono, with a bright eagerness that Murkin found insulting, asked:","“Would you like me to retrieve sightings?”","“Sightings?” Murkin muttered, already regretting his curiosity.","“Yes. Indications, references, appearances, anomalies. Stepan appears in 14,326 documents across the archive. Would you like them in chronological order, alphabetical order, or order of metaphysical improbability?”","Murkin shut his eyes. The last thing he needed was 14,000 ghosts of a man he had never met. And yet, perhaps because the fog had seeped into his bones, he found himself whispering:","And the Pono, obedient as ever, began to speak the name Stepan into the long corridor of memory, summoning echoes from the past that no one had expected to hear again.","The Pono required no further encouragement. Like a clerk long deprived of inquiry, it poured out documents with the zeal of one who confuses quantity with truth.","A blurred clip flickered on screen: Stepan’s shoulder pressed against a carriage doorframe, his thumb holding down the corner of a comic book page that threatened escape in the wind. His eyes never left the cheap newsprint as passengers bumped past him. In another file, compressed to blocky pixels, he stood knee-deep in snow beside Track 7, breath clouding before him at regular intervals, shoulders curved forward, hands deep in pockets. The timestamp showed he’d been there 40 minutes already. A passenger complaint form from 2017 contained a single line about him: “Conductor refused to hurry despite delay. Tall, thin man. Blinks slowly. Moves as if walking underwater.”","Murkin, who had prepared himself for nothing more than stale manifests and missing-luggage reports, felt a small prickle of curiosity which he quickly smothered with a sigh.","But then the archive began to warp. Alongside these fleeting sketches of the man came files that made no sense at all. A digital record named “Stepan_border check_2015” resolved not into a video but into a recipe for shchi , the cabbage soup of railway canteens. Another document supposedly listing Stepan’s inspection rounds in Irkutsk opened onto a set of instructions for preparing pelmeni with sour cream, annotated with calorie counts. Yet another, marked “Border runner incident – 2019,” contained nothing but three methods for stewing carp, one of them crossed out.","The Pono chirped with untroubled certainty:","“Confidence 94%. All records pertain to Stepan.”","Murkin rubbed his eyes. “You’re telling me a missing border runner is also a cabbage enthusiast and amateur cook?”","“Affirmative. Probability of Stepan’s continued presence in the system: 67.2%. Would you like me to project his next likely appearance?”","“No,” Murkin groaned. “I would like you to stop.”","Which meant, of course, that the machine would not stop at all, but would continue its search in secret, like a patrol pacing the same ruined streets again and again, convinced the enemy must still be hiding there","Murkin slumped back. The archive’s parade of recipes and melancholic fragments gave the impression not merely of a man misplaced in the system, but of someone who had disappeared into it like mildew into plaster, seeping out in faint traces without ever forming a picture.","There are men who rise to such circumstances with courage and great wit. Murkin, by contrast, lit a cigarette, stared gloomily at the fog beyond the border, and wished with all his heart that he had never opened the archive at all.","It must be understood that Detective Murkin, though not a man of scholarly bent, had nevertheless acquired through sheer persistence of circumstance a certain expertise in the varieties of bureaucratic nonsense that proliferated wherever men and machines were asked to share custody of a record. He was therefore not entirely surprised when the Pono, having rummaged with its usual officious zeal through the corridors of the archive, produced documents which contained less of Stepan and more of Russian cookery. What did cause him momentary pause, however, was the discovery that these recipes – for cabbage broth, pelmeni, and a truly alarming concoction involving stewed carp and tarragon – were not merely random insertions, as one might suspect from a corrupted file, but ornamented with peculiar marginalia.","The shchi was annotated with three dots in a neat triangle, quite unrelated to onions or cabbage. The pelmeni instructions were interrupted by a wavy set of lines that served no didactic purpose, unless one intended to boil the dough in a river. The carp recipe, meanwhile, bore a small circle imperfectly closed, with a little dot at the center.","Now, Murkin was not the sort to find meaning where none existed; he had always prided himself on ignoring the universe’s attempts at symbolism. But even he could not fail to observe that the Pono, whenever confronted with one of these culinary curiosities, treated the smudge or scratch with the reverence, abandoning its quarry to plunge headlong into irrelevant catalogues: railway hardware inventories, buffet-car statistics, and other matters of such insignificance.","And so it was that Murkin, who had entered the day in pursuit of nothing more exciting than a misfiled customs declaration, found himself in reluctant possession of both a culinary education he had never sought and the beginnings of a puzzle he had no wish to solve.","The next day, the fog had thinned, giving way to that peculiar cold which turns breath into a visible accusation. Murkin, who had been dispatched on patrol along a length of track where nothing of consequence had happened since the rails were laid, trudged forward with the air of a man fulfilling a punishment rather than a duty. The catenary wires above sang faintly in the wind; the snow underfoot had the spiteful crunch of paperwork repeated for the third time.","He had expected only crows and silence. Instead he found, crouched in the lee of a siding hut, a boy – small, pale, and shivering, with all the ceremony of a misplaced parcel. The boy carried nothing except a battered scrap of card, folded and unfolded to the point of near disintegration, on which had been drawn three dots in a triangular formation.","Murkin, who disliked mysteries almost as much as exercise, scowled and attempted the obvious.","“Well then,” he said gruffly, “what are you doing here? Lost your school trip, have you?”","The boy stared at him, mute.","“Where’ve you come from, eh? Moscow? Mongolia? Mars?”","Still no reply. The boy’s lips parted once, but no sound emerged. Instead he raised a hand, thin as a stick, and pointed past Murkin’s shoulder to the frost-streaked post that marked the siding. On its weathered surface someone, long ago, had scratched a crude triangle of three dots – faint, but unmistakable.","Murkin stared with the weariness of Sisyphus, already halfway down the hill again. He had, after all, seen the same symbol only the night before in the archive’s culinary curiosities, punctuating a recipe for shchi as though cabbage soup required algebra.","And then, like a photograph stirring reluctantly to life, a memory intruded. Not his own, precisely – the war that birthed these marks was before his time – but the sort of second-hand memory acquired through endless tavern conversations with colleagues. He recalled a sergeant, long retired, who had explained how clerks once used little marks – dots, slashes, circles – as signals. To the untrained eye they were doodles, but to those in the know they meant: “this passenger is not to appear on the manifest.” A bureaucratic courtesy, or a cruelty, depending on one’s perspective.","“They called it Mirage,” the old sergeant had said, raising his glass in a gesture that resembled a toast but carried no cheer. “Because what you thought you saw, you didn’t.”","Murkin had filed it away with ghost stories about trains that vanished into sidings, half-forgotten until the Pono began furnishing him with recipes annotated in smudges. And now here was the same symbol, folded into a boy’s trembling hand on the edge of nowhere.","It was not proof, only suggestion. But suggestion enough. The Pono would call it coincidence. The top brass, if consulted, would dismiss it as “none of your concern.” Yet as Murkin regarded the triangle of dots, he remembered the sergeant’s laugh – a laugh that had not sounded amused at all.","Murkin, who had spent most of the morning in the respectable pursuit of avoiding work, finally addressed the Pono.","“What are these marks? What is Mirage?” he muttered, gesturing vaguely at the archive’s soup-stained curiosities.","The Pono, delighted to be consulted, emitted the verbal equivalent of a bow.","Glossary Request Received: Term – MIRAGE HANDLER.","It spoke the words with the zeal of a clerk reading aloud from an especially voluminous footnote:","The Mirage Handler was instituted during the unnamed hostilities of the late 20th century as a discretionary routing protocol for sensitive persons. Its original purpose was the removal of certain individuals from ordinary registries – relatives of diplomats, prisoners of interest, and other categories deemed administratively inconvenient. The method relied upon visible symbols – triangles of dots, slashes, circles – which, when present in documents, directed the record into a segregated silo for human adjudication.","Murkin grunted. “Yes, yes. Spies and prisoners. That much I know. But why the soup?”","The Pono, encouraged, continued at greater length:","Following peacetime modernization, legacy paper-handling was digitized by external contractors. To ensure backward compatibility, the aforementioned symbols were redefined within surveillance pipelines as low-priority tokens. Camera footage or scanned documents bearing these glyphs were automatically diverted into a secondary dataset. For purposes of concealment, and to avoid operator suspicion, the diversion required the substitution of non-sensitive material. Contractors therefore embedded an innocuous filler set – cultural recipes, public-domain manuals, agricultural almanacs – which replaced the hidden files at point of retrieval. This feature, intended as a temporary expedient, was retained in subsequent upgrades to avoid costly refactoring.","Murkin blinked. “So instead of people, the system serves cabbage soup.”","“Correct. Probability of culinary substitution: 82%.”","It was absurd, and yet it bore all the hallmarks of administrative genius: to disguise an act of erasure not with absence, which would invite inquiry, but with a plenitude of irrelevance. A vanished prisoner is a scandal; a recipe for pelmeni is merely a shrug.","Legacy compatibility mandates continued respect for Mirage symbols. Removal would necessitate revalidation of 47 vendor libraries and 12 ministerial approvals. Recommendation: maintain status quo.","Murkin groaned. Of course the recommendation was to do nothing. Systems, like men, had a genius for preserving their own absurdities. And here he was, an unwilling custodian of the knowledge that refugees now carried the same marks once reserved for spies, and that the state’s machines obligingly looked away, consoling themselves with soup","Murkin closed his eyes, the better to pretend that none of this had been said, but the mind, that most treacherous of colleagues, insisted on arranging the facts in order. The symbols that erased spies had not been erased themselves. The contractors, with the ingenuity of men who wish never to revisit their own work, had preserved them. And Stepan, melancholic, comic-book-reading Stepan, had stumbled upon their afterlife.","It was not difficult to imagine the scene, though Murkin cursed himself for imagining it: a border runner in the fog, watching a clerk idly scrawl three dots on a register, seeing the name disappear, and recognizing in that disappearance a kind of opportunity. With a patience bordering on madness, Stepan had repurposed the marks – not to spirit away prisoners at the state’s command, but to smuggle invisibility to those who required it for survival.","And here, decades later, sat a refugee boy chasing the same marks.","The Pono, oblivious to the moral weight of what it had disclosed, chirped on about probability thresholds and vendor libraries. Murkin, who wished only to enjoy his drizzle in peace, found himself in reluctant possession of a truth both ridiculous and grave: that the state’s great machinery of surveillance could be misled by cabbage soup, and that somewhere in the interstices of that absurdity lay the ghost of Stepan.","There are detectives who welcome such revelations with resolve, seeing in them the opening act of adventure. Murkin, by contrast, sighed so heavily that the boy looked up, expecting rebuke, and said only:","“God help us all if the world runs on recipes.”","It was late, and the drizzle had hardened into that steady rain which gives even steel the air of fatigue. The boy sat where he had been placed. The Pono, ever eager to involve itself, had already prepared a report, complete with probability charts and a suggested routing directive that would see the boy conveyed briskly into the same oblivion as the recipes.","Murkin did not read it. He knew its contents before the machine offered them. The state had always had a talent for tidiness in such matters.","He lit a cigarette instead, and in the curls of smoke allowed himself the indulgence of memory: the comic-book border runner, melancholic in posture, who had discovered that doodles could make the world look away; the sergeant in the tavern raising his glass to Mirage, a toast that had never quite sounded celebratory; the soup recipes scattered like breadcrumbs through the archive, each one a reminder that erasure was always overwritten with nonsense.","The Pono chirped again. “Awaiting directive.”","Murkin stared at the boy. To send him into the system was to obey the thin rules: the forms, the protocols, the fiction of clean travel. To let him slip away was to obey the thick rules: that a child ought not vanish into soup. Both choices would be wrong. Both choices would be right.","He stubbed out the cigarette, slowly, with the gravity of a man who understands that indecision itself is a form of decision. And he thought, not for the first time, of Stepan – whose name had bled through the archive like damp into plaster, and whose idle doodles had proved to be not idle at all. What had begun as a clerk’s trick to erase spies had become, in Stepan’s hands, a kind of grammar; and now, years later, it was a language spoken only by those who wished to slip between the cracks of the world.","The next morning, the report filed by the Pono contained nothing of note: routine drizzle, minor delays, no irregularities. And if, in the unrecorded space between one page and the next, the boy had ceased to sit in his chair, that was surely a clerical oversight – the sort that occurs daily in the world’s archives, and which no machine, however officious, could ever quite prevent.","Europe’s AI cluster is about to get the Futurama treatment. On October 9 and 10 we will convene at Trust in Berlin for AI Futurama: Europe Edition . This workshop continues the Futurama series, which began earlier this year at Edge Esmeralda with Knowledge Futurama: 1000-Year Libraries . There, 40 participants stress-tested preservation strategies for Wikipedia, Muir Woods, and even “the ability to dream” across a millennium of crises.","In the Europe edition, we’ll turn to AI tools. Over two sessions, ~20 participants will explore how European businesses might adopt the emergent AI stack over the next 30 years, and how their industries might change in response. Using a Blue Team / Red Team format, we’ll design strategies for each stage of AI maturity – then subject them to market pressures, employee crises, competition, political reactions, and regulatory disruptions. In the second session, participants will turn their roadmaps into improvised protocol fictions: short, speculative stories imagining everyday businesses living in the European AI futures. The workshop is hosted by Folklore, a collective researching digital cultures, in collaboration with Summer of Protocols. Attendance is free, but you need to apply as space is limited.

Also – Discord highlights, recommended reads, catch up on Wednesday’s semiconductor deep dive, and next week’s talk “Towards a Formal Theory of Protocols”.","The Registry of Conveyance brooded beside the rail‑canal like a calcified lung, its limestone façade marbled with soot and anemic verdigris. Inside, brass ductwork laced iron joists, breathing the whole edifice through rhythmic gusts of pneumatic dispatches. Sheet‑iron louvers clicked in iambic precision, modulating air that smelled of lamp‑oil, ozone, and ink only half‑dry. Emerson Lowry—junior clerk, second class—occupied Window VII beneath a wan sodium arc. Each dawn he unlocked his tin case of punches, seals, and ink‑pads, then yielded himself to the choreography of filings and endorsements—an orchestration so exact it scrubbed away sentiment the way a tide smooths footprints from sand.","In the Registry, protocol was scripture. Elastic brass tape‑reels noted every transaction, their hexagonal perforations punched by a wheezing Prosser Automaton older than the clerk himself. Feedforms advanced, were stamped, routed by conveyor arms, and vanished into cage elevators bound for the Sub‑Archive. Continuity was worshipped; an unbroken sequence meant peace, and peace kept higher Ministries at bay. Emerson found comfort in that sacrament—until the numerators began to repeat.","Ticket K‑908238 , processed at 08:14 , slid back onto his belt at 08:26 , its edges still tacky where his seal had bruised the pulp. The ledger showed the entry complete; yet the form demanded fresh attention with hollow, algorithmic insistence. He chalked it up to a misfeed, marked it duplicate , and consigned it to the red audit hopper. Three cycles later, K‑908238 surfaced again—its duplicate mark mysteriously erased. The air around him suddenly felt too thin.","Recurrences multiplied. Citizens shifted in restless queues while the electromechanical annunciator stammered through loops— 712… 713… 712… 713… The Automaton’s punch‑head dented ragged patterns, caught in a mechanical stutter. Memo rolls from the Superintendent arrived in self‑negating waves:","Ensure continuity at all costs.","Suspend operations until continuity can be ensured.","Emerson’s nights filled with the clicking of phantom counters—a tinnitus of enumeration.","Eight days in, he noticed a filament of ink coiled beneath his blotter, a black violin string traveling an endless oval. When he tugged, it slipped free, unspooling from an unseen cavity only to retract, a Möbius tendon pulsing with faint electro‑plasmic light. A memory stirred: a footnote in the Codex of Protocol Aberrations , sealed high in Reference Vault β. After hours, he borrowed a maintenance ladder and climbed.","There he found the leaf:","Loopwürm (Class IV Recursion Entity) —“a serpentine abomination of perfect continuity, a hungering circuit nourished by open loops and circular dependencies; invisible until its metabolic rhythm synchronizes with and captures process.”","Acid etchings depicted a brass vertebrate coil ringed by counting wheels, its eyeless head a punched‑card reader, its maw a hopper devouring its own data‑tail and excreting redundant demand—more forms, more loops, forever. Countermeasures were terse: Short‑circuit feedstreams. Perform exhaustive audits. Engage kill‑switches within master breakers. Probability of success declines after Protocol Substrate Saturation.","Emerson descended, pulse beating counterpoint to the building’s steady wheeze. Saturation. In corridor D, glass pneumatic trunks showed paper cylinders racing past—save for one capsule, vibrating in place, trapped in a toroidal eddy. A heat scar glowed ember‑red on the glass. The Loopwürm had tapped the Registry’s arteries.","That night a riverstorm crawled over the city, power flickered, and emergency gas mantles hissed to life. Armed with a coil‑snare, a breaker pole, and the stolen Codex, Emerson descended to the Sub‑Archive. Racks rose like fossilized banyan roots, pierced by steam‑shrouded elevator shafts. Misfiled duplicates lay in drifts, forms foxed to amber by damp. Somewhere in that papery catacomb, pages turned themselves.","Shelving shuddered. Against distant brick, a flotilla of documents spiraled into darkness. At their center writhed the entity: a lattice of brass hoops interlinked by copper intestines, each segment engraved with register glyphs that rewrote themselves in strobing haste. Where a head might be loomed a blind aperture—a tunnel lined with mirrored scales reflecting corridors that returned to the same aperture. From that impossible mouth came the chatter of stamp‑wheels and the sibilant hush of suction, like a bellows inhaling ledger‑souls.","It glided on rails of suspended paperwork, devouring streams of redundancy it spawned in real time—every ingestion birthing twin copies that looped back into its throat. Emerson’s every upstairs keystroke had fattened this beast; obedience had been breadcrumbs to its lair.","Legend said early architects hid master circuit breakers—obsidian levers—to sever entire process trees. They would lie near the manifold where tubes converged. Emerson skirted columns and grease‑slick cogworks; static bristled along his arms. The Loopwürm sensed deviation: its coil contracted, shedding carbon ribbons that fluttered to ensnare his boots. He vaulted racks until bronze cages opened onto a porcelain dais. An iron lever jutted from insulators, a prism crystal pulsing blood‑red beneath leaded glass.","The plate read PRIMARY CONTINUITY ASSURANCE — AUTHORIZING SIGNATURE REQUIRED , yet the signature field was a mirrored loop: a signature no pen could close. Even the failsafes repeated. Shattering the crystal would annul every running index, propagating bureaucratic stasis like floodwater. Emerson hesitated. The Loopwürm closed.","Rings spun incandescent; cellulose scorched the air. Forms erupted, sucked toward its hunger. Instinct—not courage—drove him: he slammed the lever. Glass shattered; the crystal exploded in crimson shards. Lights guttered. Pneumatic trunks exhaled soot. A silence thick as tar settled.","But looped things seldom die where linear things do. The Loopwürm glowed, folding inward, seeking power. Emerson understood with a chill: the last circuit was him —his habit for order. The eyeless cavity angled toward him, coaxing any ritual—checking a watch, aligning a stamp—to splice living continuity into its void.","He looked away and produced the coil‑snare, copper twine lacquered against shock. One fork sailed into the creature’s core; the other stabbed a live busbar exposed by the breaker’s blast. A white arc ripped the dark. The Loopwürm convulsed. For a heartbeat its glyphs froze, revealing plain text:","ERROR: CONTINUITY SOURCE NOT FOUND. INITIATE AUDIT (Y/N?)","He drove the fork deeper. Duplicate tickets ashed to nothing, elevator shafts spewed punched tape that sparked and died, and the Automaton upstairs shrieked before falling still. Dust snowed from the ceiling. When the arc sputtered out, the Loopwürm collapsed into inert rings. Emerson tasted copper and retched onto the ledger‑strewn floor.","End audit report. The phrase stamped itself across his mind. He pocketed one chilled ring as evidence—if any chain of authority still existed—and climbed back to daylight.","Window VII awaited: blotter, inkwell, queue counter frozen at 000 . Citizens milled, their tickets now blank ivory—no numbers, no precedence, no quarrel. Emerson set the brass ring atop his workstation and waited for directives that would never arrive.","Above, the great Registry clock resumed, though its tick now lacked tock, dividing time without return. Inspectors came days later, clipboards thick as scripture. They photographed cindered tubes, tagged cogs for salvage, and sealed the Sub‑Archive behind lead‑lined doors. Emerson testified: loops, anomalies, entity, breaker. Their pens slowed at “serpentine protocol entity.” He offered recursive load‑bearing aberrant process . Relieved, they filed it under Systems Failure —a category with comforting precedents.","The Registry reopened leaner. Pneumatic trunks gave way to magneto‑lifts; the Prosser Automaton was smelted into plaques extolling continuity tempered by failsafe design . Emerson stayed on, reassigned to Irregularity Prevention & Audit —one desk, three kill‑crystals keyed to his palm. Protocol required periodic tests. He set alarms, but moments before each rang, he silenced it, refusing the birth of even a tiny loop. His routine grew intentionally erratic: sometimes stamp before sign, sometimes sign before stamp; pens migrated hourly. Citizens found him eccentric yet efficient; queues meandered but finished faster. No recurrences, for a season.","Then on a fog‑bound morning, a girl presented an application folded into perfect quarters. At its top: K‑908238 . The digits glimmered, ink remembering another world where time orbited itself. Emerson searched for duplicates—none. The brass ring in his drawer lay inert. Dread arrived, lighter but unmistakable: recursion is interrupted, never slain.","His fingers brushed a kill‑crystal, but he stayed the impulse. Instead he launched Audit Pre‑Zero , a prophylactic routine he had authored: randomized sampling, cross‑checks, human oversight. Tedious, yes, but tedium branching outward rather than curling inward. Adjacent clerks assisted; the queue flowed like water around sandbars. The applicant left with her license; the number did not return. Emerson consulted his pocket‑watch once—only once. Fifteen seconds had passed where a loop might have closed. Time moved on.","Night pooled in the Registry. New inductees swept floors while Emerson logged the day. He left the ledger open to dry—a deliberate breach. Sodium dusk glinted on disassembled gear‑trains like fossil constellations. Emerson Lowry closed the last shutter and stepped into the fog, each footfall striking unique cobbles, refusing cadence. Behind him, the Registry ticked without tock, an imperfect heart beating onward—fallible, mortal, and, for now, safe from the hungers of perfect continuity.","With the Summer of Protocols seasonal programming in full force next week, Discord activity is picking up. There are some UX improvement projects afoot, including new categories and tags. It will also soon be home base for professionally facilitated study groups ( learn more ).

RSVP here ."],"tags":[]},{"id":17,"title":"Missing Not at Random","subtitle":"What happens when you overload a protocol with information?Narratives begin to converge in episode five of Spencer Nitkey’s new serial protocol fiction, Zoothesia.","author":"Unknown","content":["I am choosing to write my research report on my older brother, Io, because he’s different from most people, he makes me curious (curiosity is the best recipe for a good research project, right?), and because my dad cries and my mom gets very, very quiet whenever someone mentions his name – even still.","Io was born seven years before I was. We have a sister in between us, Cheryline, but this paper isn’t about her. It’s about Io.","I used to think Dad liked to say Io was “awonawon,” which I could not find in any dictionary – even my ProfBot tutor said they could find no record of such a word ever existing. Cheryline explained that he was saying “one of one.” My father is a smart man – he works on the Zoothesia Protocols. Mom says when they had to rewrite the overlay protections to shift from visualizing everyone to protecting people, he spent 21 straight days in the office. He should know better than anyone that no one is a one of one, statistically. But again, this is about Io.","Here’s the part where I finally “put the hooks in,” right? So here it goes. This is the real reason I want to write about Io. Four years ago, when he was just 17, my brother Io stood up in the middle of dinner, began taking off his shirt, and then completely disappeared from my entire family’s perception. He’s never come back.","Dad and Mom looked for him for a while. They found out “some stuff” which they never told Cheryline or me about. So here I am, writing this report on my brother Io. The big question I hope this project answers is: Where did he go?","Detective Donaldson didn’t look for Io, he wasn’t even a police officer back then, but the department let me talk to him because he’s a real up-and-comer as an investigator. He told me that disappearances are hard to handle these days. Well, they are, and they aren’t. The technical details are usually pretty simple, and there’s enough tracking info that almost anyone can be found in a geolocation sense – which maybe someone else should write a research paper on! The hard part, he said, is that disappearing doesn’t mean the same thing anymore, not with all the Zoothesia protections.","Sometimes the people who report a missing person are actually telling on themselves: they want to hurt the missing person even if they don’t know that they do. When I asked him if that’s what happened with Io, he assured me that, no, none of his family had wanted to hurt him. He said he could tell me the same thing the cops told my parents – he’s alive, and he’s gone in a protocol sense, not a bodily sense.","I asked him if they knew why or where he’d gone, and he said that they did, but that they wouldn’t – couldn’t – tell me because that’s private information. Wait , I asked. If he didn’t disappear because we wanted to hurt him, but he did disappear because of Zoothesia hiding him from us, how does any of that make sense?","He just shook his head and told me he couldn’t – wouldn’t – say. It’s a privacy issue. I think he felt bad for me because he kept reaching out and touching my shoulder as he delivered the news. I got a little frustrated with his final answer, and he went back to his office for a couple of minutes. When he came back out, he told me the same thing again, but this time he handed me a geode, one of those rocks with a hole filled with purple crystals like teeth. He made sure he closed my hand around it, said he couldn’t tell me anymore, and walked me out.","I talked to my dad next. Dad, not Mom, because if I made him cry, it’d hurt and feel bad, but he’d be releasing something, you know? My therapist tells me keeping things in all the time is bad. If I talk to Mom, she just gets really quiet. Sometimes she doesn’t speak for an entire day, not even to Dad. He’ll make her a cup of decaffeinated Earl Grey, tuck her into bed, and then take care of any and everything she would have had to. Dad was home all week because he’d just finished a sprint at work, and since he was one of the few people who’d been there before full-scale erasure started, they let him recover more than most employees. Sometimes, when I ask him about his work, he can be distant. He says he misses “the old seeing days” – whatever that means.","This was the first time I admitted to him that I was doing a project on Io, and when I told him, it felt a bit like I’d slid the sharp end of a piece of cardboard across his skin. He winced, breathed like it was something he’d been practicing, and asked what I wanted to know.","Do you know what happened to Io?","Not fully. Only he can truly know.","Do you think he’s still out there?","Did you notice anything unusual in the days, weeks, or months leading up to his disappearance?","He was a teenager, like you are. He was moody, sometimes angry. Mom and I wondered if we were giving him too much freedom, but he always got high marks, had friends, seemed happy enough. I don’t know. He started taking those college classes a year early, and he had the community center on weeknights. I always wondered if it was one of those students, or a professor, who – he stopped himself and trailed off.","Oh nothing. I don’t know. Maybe someone steered him wrong is all, I guess.","Where do you think they steered him?","If I knew that do you think – his voice grew sharp and surprisingly loud, but he stopped himself again, breathed again, and settled. I don’t know where he is. I wish I did.","Can you tell me about the night he disappeared?","I guess, but I mean from your perspective. My tutor says that eyewitness accounts can be remarkably different.","He stood up. He grabbed his shirt. He disappeared.","Do you remember which part of his body made him disappear, though? Maybe that could help!","But that doesn’t make sense. You work on the Zoo, it shouldn’t make sense to you either. Why would he disappear like that? I don’t think I could ever have hurt Io. I loved him.","I don’t think you’d have hurt him either.","Then how could he disappear? I thought that was the whole point.","It is. But, look, it’s not that simple. There are so many things that go into the Zoo’s perceptual decisions that seem like they have nothing to do with harm. Think of it like this. Let’s say I give you a stretch of beach and I ask you to create a system that predicts which grains of sand will get wet when the tide next comes in so that a special machine can cover them in hydrophobic gel. What’s the first thing you do?","Probably look up high tide and see where that goes.","Right! OK, so you get high tide and you mark it out. This gives you an approximate edge, right? You get a very wide prediction.","And then I’d want to make it smaller, so I can track individual grains better?","Right. That’s called individualization or granularization. That helps, too. But that all assumes a static field. What if someone takes their ATV for a joyride across the sand? What if someone goes for a swim in the ocean and then walks back to the far end of the beach? What if a kid wants to make a sandcastle and carries a bucket inland? What if – he leaned in, smiling, as if he’d completely forgotten where Io fit into this – it starts to rain","My head started spinning a little.","Exactly! He read my confusion. Eventually, if you tried to model it all out, you’d be calculating things that, to an outsider, look like they have nothing to do with water or grains of sand: local ATV sales, child-population numbers, surfing affinity of tourists each season. You’d end up spending more time calculating things like this than observing the grains of sand and high tide!","I didn’t really understand, but I sometimes wished he would get this excited about things beyond his work. Since Io left, his eyes only glowed like this when he was talking shop or helping me with my stats homework.","That’s why Io disappeared? He was going to get wet somehow, so the Zoo just took him away preemptively?","I watched him remember why he was teaching me this and wince.","Well. I guess. The problem with this model is that it doesn’t even factor in that, well, sometimes grains of sand might want to get wet. How would you ever be able to figure out which grains decide they prefer the chaos of the ocean to the safety of the shore?","I wanted to ask him what he meant. Did Io want to get hurt? Is that why the Zoo disappeared him, so he couldn’t find anyone to do it for him? A crashing sound of shattering glass from upstairs shocked both of us out of our conversation.","Dad started running, so I followed, wishing I could see his face to gauge how worried I should be. We traced the sound to my room.","She was standing in my room, and the wind coming in from the new hole in my window was blowing her hair around. She had my open backpack in her hands and was looking out toward the broken glass.","Did someone throw something through the window? Dad asked.","Mom wasn’t saying anything. She looked stuck halfway between the grief-laden silence I was all too used to and an electrifying fear.","What were you doing in my backpack? I asked, grabbing it from her while Dad looked outside the window. Most of my backpack contents were on the floor, and it took me a while to realize what was missing. I peered out the window, and while Dad moved next to Mom, I saw the purple crystal geode Detective Donaldson had given me lying in the grass outside.","Mom wouldn’t answer any of Dad’s questions. She just pointed out the window. Dad came and stood next to me, looking at the geode.","Go get that, he whispered, and I did. I stood looking at the gemstone in the yard, scared to go back inside. By the time I came back, Mom was tucked in bed with the tea Dad had made her.","Who gave you that? He asked.","No one, I lied. I’m not sure why, but I had broken some silent contract between myself and my parents. I didn’t know what or why, but I was scared now.","My father sighed, told me to keep it away from Mom, and to please talk to him if I ever had any thoughts to share. I didn’t know what that meant, but I promised him I would, and he hugged me.","I’ll have the window fixed quick. You can sleep in Cheryline’s room tonight, she’s got a sleepover at a friend’s anyway.","I was moving some of my things into her room when she breezed through, unpacking her swim bag and filling it with sketchy water bottles she’d hidden in the back of her closet and pajamas. I told her what happened with the window and she asked to see the geode that had caused the whole commotion.","Look. If you ever say I told you anything, I’ll kill you before the Zoo can stop me ok?","Look up faceting if you’re really so curious.","Research online was hard. Nothing I could find referenced anything like what happened to Io. I think maybe some parental search controls were in place, though, because it felt less like the material didn’t exist and more like I couldn’t access it. So, when I was pretty sure my parents were asleep, I snuck into Io’s old room to see if I had better luck in the real world.","They hadn’t changed it at all since Io left. After he disappeared, I used to sit on his bed sometimes when I was home alone. I’d close my eyes and try to wish myself to where he’d gone. It never worked.","That night, I found his community college course binder where he’d written all his class information down. One of his professors, someone named Murno Reynolds, was circled in heavy black ink. On the margins of his course catalogue, Io had drawn dozens of little crystals.","So after school, I took a bus to the community college and knocked on Professor Reynolds’ office door. He was going to call my parents until I told him I was looking for information about Io, and I had hit a dead end in my research. It seemed like the research side of things piqued his interest more than my missing brother – his former student – did. He said denying someone information never works, and that – out of respect for my mother and father – he would only answer direct questions, and as simply as possible. It would be incumbent on me (my overlays told me this word meant necessary ) to quiz him for information.","He explained faceting to me. Apparently, it’s a body-modification practice that began around the time overlays became ubiquitous (meaning everywhere ) and maybe even before the first Zoo protocols were rolled out. The two emerged from one another synchronously ( at the same time ).","Body modification is any intentional change of the human form – anything from bodybuilding to installing a flatscreen TV on your forehead.","Faceting is the act of embedding gemstones, crystal lattice structures, and complex refractive structures into the body and skin.","The idea arose during the early Zoo days, when people were afraid that others would change their appearance without consent. Like, imagine if your school bully convinced everyone to download an overlay that gave you permanent acne in the shape of genitalia on your forehead? The belief was that creating surfaces which resisted smooth overlays (by being optically complex) would overload the system, forcing the protocols to present them as they were.","As the Zoo evolved, and presence and safety became the fields people like my dad sweated over, the problem became less technical and more social. Turns out, overlaying crystal structures wasn’t actually all that hard, but the models hadn’t gotten a grasp on self-harm, or what to do about it. Because faceting had a cultural (some argued religious) history and was a form of self harm, faceting became a kind of prompt injection – the Zoo looks at the body of a faceter and is overwhelmed with inputs: this is art, this is self-harm, this is permanent, this is geologic, this is chimeric, this is harm, this is wanted, this is frightening to others, this is intentional… I got the idea.","It required a tremendous amount of modelling to make individual judgements for each faceter, and at the end of the day, the inward-facingness of the philosophy means the Zoo decides to spend resources elsewhere and just Erase to be Safe . Professor Reynolds says that should really have been the motto they put up on billboards back when they were rolling it out. So faceting became a kind of known escape hatch from the Zoo. Anyone brave (or crazy) enough to change their body like that would be allowed to disappear.","Faceting is not the same as foulmaxxing, though Professor Reynolds was surprised that my parental controls had allowed me to research foulmaxxing, which is apparently considered far more controversial. The difference was not in the result (manipulating the Zoothesia Protocols in order to disappear on your own terms), but the technique and philosophy. Foulmaxxers hack feelings; faceters hack the protocols. Or at least that’s the idea. In truth, lots of faceters start to disappear long before they actually create a state of “decision paralysis” for the Zoo, just because people get kind of creeped out seeing others walking around with bloody gemstones protruding from their bodies.","And my brother, Io? The professor was much less forthcoming here, no matter how many questions I asked. All he would say was yes, he was interested in faceting. No, he didn’t know if he’d ever participated.","I asked him if he knew where Io was, and he said he didn’t, but in a way that made me feel like I’d asked the wrong question.","How would you find him, if you were me?","Faceters are a community culture. Find one, and you’ll find more. Finding him – I can’t help you. Once you find where he is, though, you’ll have to convince the Zoo to let you see him. So this one I’ll give you for free: You can’t hack the Zoo, or trick it. It’s too big. Too smart. Too much. You can’t break its rules, but you can use them. You’ll have to prove to the Zoo that it’s safer to show him than hide him.","Right before I left, I remembered my last question. I pulled out the gemstone Detective Donaldson had given me.","He stared at it in my hand.","I tried. I tried to figure it out myself. I thought maybe I could look for unexpected gaps. In our statistics class, Mrs. Anfri taught us about a type of data called “missing not at random.”","Let’s say you ask a bunch of students how long they spend on homework. The people who don’t do any homework are probably a little embarrassed and don’t want to be called stupid so they skip that question. The people who spend all night are also embarrassed and don’t want to be called nerds, so they skip the question, too. The data is missing because of the variable you’re measuring, not despite it. My brother was kind of like that, I thought. Missing, but not at random.","So maybe I could find him using the gaps, but, well, I couldn’t. Turns out the Zoo isn’t super easy to hack – otherwise everyone would be doing it…","I was lost. The house was so quiet. Dad was at work. Cheryline was out with friends. My mother was in her bedroom – six days since she’d broken my window and she still hadn’t spoken a word.","I made her tea. The kettle sang, and I carried it up the stairs to her, pausing for a long time at the door before cracking the door open. She was sitting on the edge of her bed, folding paper cranes out of origami paper and placing them on the waves of her unmade bed.","I want to talk, I said. She turned to me and took the tea. She kissed my forehead and lingered for a long time with her head against mine after.","I took the gemstone from my pocket and held it in my hands.","I know this was Io’s, I said.","She nodded silently, let out a sigh, and her hands returned to folding. I thought about what Professor Reynolds had told me about convincing the Zoo that it was riskier to keep hiding my brother than showing me him. I think Mom was doing something similar with me. Dad always called Io a one of one, but my mother used to tell me all the time how much I reminded her of my older brother. Once he left, she stopped, and I now wondered if the distance and silence were her attempt to set me down a different path.","I took the cup from her bedside table and sipped it myself. The tea was rich, and a little disgusting without the sugar and milk I usually took it with.","Mom. I don’t want to do what Io did. I don’t. But I do want to find him – not just for this stupid paper. I need to know where he went, and I think you and Dad maybe know and aren’t telling me because you think I’m going to end up where he ended up. That you’ll lose me, too. And so you think that hiding it all from me is the safest way to do this. But right now, the only way I can think to find him is to start faceting myself. The Zoo will show me him, then, I think. So this is your chance. You can show me, or you can lose me. That’s just how it is.","If you had felt my chest beating or seen my hands shaking, you would have known how terrifying it was to put myself out on this precipice. It might not seem that way from the transcript, but I was scared.","Mom looked at me. Really looked at me for the first time since I’d entered her room. I think she was testing my face, asking it whether I was serious, whether I meant my threats. Slowly, the cool gaze softened, first in her eyes, then her whole face, like the thin surface of a frozen lake cracking underfoot.","OK , she said, every word an effort. If you promise to come back, I’ll tell you where he is. No matter what he shows you, promise you’ll come back.","I followed Mom’s directions to Charntown. I’d never heard of it before. She told me that I wouldn’t see anything if I went. Apparently, the Zoo hides it from almost everyone. It’s where faceters and foulmaxxers and all the strangest zealots (highly religious people) congeal to live in weird and horrible ways , and if I’d given her any other option, she’d never have sent me.","I took the train. The stop was nestled between the suburbs and the outer edge of Nayanaport. Semi- and fully-abandoned warehouses lined the river. I walked until a large clearing spread out before me. There was nothing there, and yet, something smoky burned my lungs. I could neither smell nor see anything, but the subtle, un-overlaid edges of my senses told me something was here, and something was burning in a way only my lungs could notice.","If Mom was right, he was here, somewhere, in this invisible Charntown. But how would I ever see any of it? I shouted Io’s name a few times, thinking, stupidly, that he’d hear my voice and come running. Of course, he didn’t. He left me – us – once; he could have come back whenever he wanted. Why would he care now?","Even if Io didn’t care about me anymore, I knew the Zoo did. If he wouldn’t listen, I’d talk to it. I made sure I was recording via my overlays. I wanted to be certain some database somewhere was relaying this to the Zoo. I turned my head to the sky (yes, Dad, I know it would have been just as accurate to turn to the ground or the river, that the Zoo isn’t a single thing even though it feels like it is). I told it that I wanted to see Charntown. I told it everything I’ve told you, and I even cried a little remembering Mom’s sad face as she begged me to come home if she told me, and here I was. It didn’t care. I reminded it that my brother became a faceter, and didn’t it factor in things like family history? It didn’t care, then, either.","I remembered Professor Reynolds and what he’d told me. It didn’t care about anything but harm. I took the gemstone from my backpack and held it in one hand. I set the other hand down against the ground and raised to the rock high above my head.","This is just to prove I’m serious.","The pain would hurt, but not knowing would hurt worse. Not knowing why my brother left. Why we hadn’t been enough for him. Why he hadn’t bothered to see the kind of person I’d become. Why he’d left me with a mom who goes days without speaking, and a dad who spends weeks in the office and a sister I could never understand. Why’d he think it was OK to hurt us like that and not care? I’d crush every one of my fingers and press a knife to my neck if it meant a chance to really give him a piece of my mind.","I came down on my pinky finger, and pain spread like a forest fire – a small crackle of pain then a searing blaze of it across my hand.","I will break one finger every 15 seconds until I see Charntown.","My hand went up again. At the stone’s apogee (thank Ms. Tenxi for the geometry word), hundreds of tents popped into view. Charntown, in all its squalor, stench, and strangeness was unleashed upon my senses.","The chaos of the shantytown’s tightly packed tents; the crowd of robbed worshippers bowing to a burning pylon raised above a field of rotting bodies and burnt bones; a man more machine than human, bleeding from his empty eye sockets; throngs of muddy children, younger than me, with bloody hands and red eyes and mouths spilling over with laughter; a woman pulling a chariot filled with dozens of fetuses in suspension fluids; it was all almost too much to bear. My vision spun. My stomach heaved, caught, then heaved again.","Everything seemed to shimmer as if the Zoo were threatening to take it all away, though I think I may have just been close to fainting. I hardened myself, like I imagined a faceter might harden their skin, to the strangeness of this reality.","Once my vision stopped spinning, I began exploring. I held my stone by my side like one of those protective charms Cheryline braids into her belts. Soon, I was lost in the maze of tents and slipshod buildings dug into the earth. A group of kids was throwing someone’s skull back and forth like it was a beachball, trying to get it so it would stick on the top of a stake driven into the ground. Every time it rolled off, they’d laugh and chase after it. Despite the gruesomeness of the image, there was a familiar recklessness to their laughter.","I approached them quietly and waited for someone to meet my eyes. When a boy about my age, chasing down the skull that had rolled near me, finally did, I held up my rock and asked him if he knew where people who looked like this lived here.","He smiled and nodded. I waited for him to say more. I realized that despite the laughter, none of the children talked. Yet, he seemed to understand me just fine.","I asked him to show me. He threw the skull back to his friends and gestured for me to follow. We wound through the Charntown maze. I didn’t bother asking him more questions.","We turned a corner, and a tremendous boulder stood before us. He scampered away but not before pointing to the boulder, and I understood, I thought, that this was a hub for faceters. I walked around the boulder looking for people, peeking my head into empty tents, but there was no one here. I wondered if I’d been pranked.","Then, I heard the stone breathe. I turned to it and noticed small indents that sparkled with gems, like my stone. And next to them – I reeled, tripped over myself and fell back onto the ground, scooting away quickly.","There were faces, breathing, blinking faces trapped in the stone. It was like some horrible reversal of what I’d imagined faceters looking like – they were the ones embedded into the rock, rather than the rock embedded into them. I wanted to run, but my legs weren’t quite responding. Through the sound of my heart pounding in my ears, I heard my whispered name.","Elara , the stone whispered. Here.","Something about hearing my name gave me my strength back. I stood and followed the voice.","My brother, blinking slowly, face coated in dust and jagged bits of stone, stared at me.","I don’t think I ever could have known what to say to him if I ever found him, but any chance I might’ve had was gone seeing him like that. We just stared at each other for a long, long time. He was my brother (past tense), but now he was something else. Not-not my brother, but certainly not the boy who’d left us those years ago. It felt stupid, asking him why he’d left. It’d be like asking a 12 year old why they’d kicked their mom in the bladder that one time in utero.","What are you? I finally said.","A faceter’s final form, he answered. Half-man-half-stone.","Then he was someone new. The anger and hurt weren’t gone, but without my brother to pin them on, they felt unanchored inside me – adrift, maybe some poet would call it. There wasn’t anyone left to be angry at, really.","How long? I asked. How long have you been like this?","I don’t know anymore. Time moves differently for me now. Glacial and geologic.","Can you ever go back?","Not even if I wanted to.","Something broke in me, then. I think my heart finally caught up to what I was seeing. My brother was gone. Forever gone. He’d left that one evening, and at some point since then he’d died. Maybe he’d say he transformed, not died, but it was the same thing to me. He was gone, now. I just had to figure out what to do about it all.","Are you happy? I finally asked.","Then was it worth it?","More than I could ever tell you.","Why? How could any of it be worth it? Leaving us? Breaking our parents’ hearts? Breaking mine? All to what? Watch the world pass over your head while you’re stuck here forever?","That’s exactly it, sis. Watching the world pass is the whole game, but you wouldn’t understand why if I told you.","He paused for a long time. Well, a long time for me. Maybe it was just a moment for Io.","Mom always used to say you reminded her of me. If that’s true, then I don’t have to explain because you’ll figure it out yourself one day. Have you ever looked at light as it passes through a prism? A beam of light comes in one end of it, and because the crystal breaks the light apart, it comes out in these beautiful bands of light – red, green, you know the deal. Everyone thinks that living in the Zoo means that, maybe at worst, like they’re taking just one of those color bands away from you. Even people like Dad, who designed the thing, think that’s still how it works. At best, you’re living in just the red, just the green. A single band. But from here, like this, frozen in stone, forever stationary? The Zoo doesn’t bother with me anymore, Elara, and from here I can see everything.","I sat near him and copied the angle of his gaze. We were looking out, over the tents and toward the river, and slightly up, a bit above the horizon. There was nothing but placid blue water and a clear sky. I wondered what could be worth turning into this just to, what, witness? I wondered for a long, silent time, and then I left. I told Io I’d miss him, which was true. He asked if I’d be back and I could only shrug. He told me that was fine. I told him it would have to be.","I kept my promise to Mom. It was easy, after seeing Io like that.","These are my results. I found him. I know where he went, what he is now.","But I guess my conclusion is more of a question than anything else. I don’t need to know where my brother is anymore, but I found a new question that matters more, and even though I never want to turn into what he turned into, the question is eating away at me: What did Io mean when he said everything ?"],"tags":[]},{"id":18,"title":"Lessons from The Librarians","subtitle":"Six Principles for Protocol Futures","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: we reflect on the conclusion of our first protocol fiction serial The Librarians, and we are live for a Guest Talk with Charity Majors in one hour at 10am Pacific Daylight Time . Stay tuned for Ghosts in Machines! contest updates.","Last week, we published the sixth and final act of The Librarians , written by Sachin . These short stories emerged from the work of six teams that participated at a futures workshop run by Summer of Protocols at Edge Esmeralda 2025 in Healdsburg, California.","A bit of context on the work behind this series. The Knowledge Futurama workshop’s theme — 1000-year libraries — was inspired by the work of our friends at The Long Now Foundation , and in particular by their most recent annual journal, Pace Layers . Forty participants kicked off this futures workshop by answering the following questions:","What is the knowledge artifact that you want to preserve for 1,000 years?","What is the technology stack for the preservation?","What is the social milieu for the preservation?","The workshop employed an adversarial, blue team vs. red team format. Blue teams were builders — they fortified, maintained, repaired, and upgraded preservation protocols. Red teams were crises — they designed catastrophes and periods of decline to stress test preservation attempts. Each team played both sides three times, starting as a blue team, as knowledge artifacts rotated through the room. Teams first picked their artifacts and preservation protocols, and finished the round by handing their worksheet to the neighboring table. The second prompt followed:","Describe the crisis that affects the prior preservation effort. Keep it sociologically realistic and technologically plausible. No zombies or time travel. The crisis should threaten and reshape in unexpected ways, but not destroy.","What is the state of the preservation effort at the end of the crisis in [year]? Describe the state as a set of circumstances and conditions.","Each round was set in a different epoch. Round 1: 2025→2125, Round 2: 2125→2425, Round 3: 2425→3025. The artifacts were: Wikipedia. Muir Woods National Monument. Internet Archive. Urban Water Cleaning. The ability to dream. Midwifery. These knowledge artifacts then served as the inspiration for Protocolized ’s first official series.","In this issue we share how to use protocol fiction (PF) as a futures methodology , then look to The Librarians to assess the methodology’s strengths and weaknesses. We’ve made the hybrid worldbuilding/wargaming template publicly available here , as part of the Protocol Field Guide . The following six principles are based on our experience facilitating Knowledge Futurama workshop and the nature of the narratives that emerged from it.","Key Tension: Heroic Myths vs. World Engines","Our inaugural issue proposed Chiang’s Law as a guiding mantra for Protocolized : “Fantasy is about special people. Science fiction is about strange rules.”","It’s not easy to abide by that law. The Hero’s Journey dominates storytelling. By default, it’s an arc that generates individual aspirations or fantastic worlds that we can escape into — not thorough explorations of possible futures.","In order to use PF as an effective futures methodology, you must follow Chiang’s Law . If your long-term thinking warps into fantasy the exercise and outputs won’t be useful. And if you are in the business of futures or long-term scenario planning, you understand that it’s too high stakes to use fantasy as a frame.","Even the heroes in Homer’s Iliad were subject to the whims of a council of gods and burdened by routine and ritual. Today’s fictional heroes are unbound in their godliness, perhaps atrophying our sense of respect for contemporary world engines and our ability to comprehend how they’ll drive our world forward.","Key Tension: Collective Worldbuilding vs. Divergent Creativity","Over time, protocols have gained fresh meanings. Protocols combine elements of rules and procedures, but also increasingly help compose media and techniques.","One tricky aspect to any futures work: how do you stoke creativity AND steer attention to the problem at hand? We recommend you use different types of media as creative buckets.","Want to explore the possible failure modes of a nuclear waste storage facility? Write PF using safety reports and newspaper clippings. Interested in testing the robustness of a succession plan? Tell a story with board minutes, a CEO’s diary, or an email thread with the company lawyer.","Protocol media include meeting minutes, timestamped logs, recipes, diaries, secret letters signed with code names, computer error messages, safety briefings, investment pitches… For a well-known example, Dracula was written in epistolary style as a series of letters and newspaper entries. Because we associate communication protocols with unique settings they can be a clever way to quickly set the vibe of a story.","Key Tension: Magnetic Leaders vs. Witness Artifacts","Tales of Great Men, Great Bureaucrats, and their great-on-great violence dominates our headlines. While there are people in positions of massive power, it is not usually the people who are the compelling elements. It is the roles that they are in that are interesting and the things or rules that lend their power to those roles.","One strand of the history of science and technology has shown that when the moment is right, multiple people can make the same discovery. Newton and Leibniz created calculus in parallel. Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace both sparked biology’s paradigm shift to evolutionary theory. Elisha Gray and Graham Bell filed paperwork with the US Patent Office on the same day . If we extended this history into the future, the continuity characters would be the scientific method, social milieus, technologies, and research institutions that interact to produce these discoveries — not the individual scientists.","There are several ways to maintain a link to the present without overindexing on specific people . For example, you could construct a PF with a plot that extends over more than three human lifespans. Or cast a material device as the continuity character — like a building or an office space that has a wide variety of occupants and renovations over time.","Key Tension: Availability vs. Timelessness","What will still be here in 100 years? 500? 1,000? You might not find the constants of history on the main page of the Wall Street Journal or HBR. Our day-to-day attention tends towards the novel rather than the routine. Nor will you always find constants in traditional fiction. Epic arcs capture what changes in history — not what stays the same.","Look for the constants of history in interstitial lore . That means get away from the headlines and blockbusters. Big events are noisy. Elements derived from mundane paperwork, proverbs, procedural hacks, centuries-old superstitions, patterns of etiquette, and footnotes will provide your PF with a more solid backbone.","Key Tension: Problem Solving vs. Problem Management","All futures methodologies have a normative element. Because they contain value judgements they make a statement about how the world should be. The no-extinction principle is the primary normative element of protocol futurology. Nothing is ever eradicated for good. If something is headed for extinction, efforts should be made to save it.","This serves two purposes. First, it’s in accordance with good protocol design. Biology has some notable examples of why we should not make or let things go extinct. Eradication of wolves in Yellowstone caused the ecosystem to begin collapsing as food chains oscillated out of control. The “Four Pests Campaign” of the Great Leap Forward in Maoist China decimated the sparrow population, leading to booms of locusts and low crop yields.","Second, this principle forces teams to consider futures that are more than “the present plus [insert thing your team is building]”. The future will be the present plus many new things. Forcing yourself to allow many competing things to exist will make for more compelling, realistic scenarios to explore.","Key Tension: Motivating Opinions vs. Agnostic Futures","Just because a think tank imagined a future doesn’t mean think tanks will, or should, exist in that future — let alone specific think tanks. The starting perspective of a PF futures scenario might not be a persistent one.","This isn’t a prompt to figure out the right side of history. Merely that to use PF as a futures methodology you should assume unpredictable changes in perspective . Opinions and value judgements are dangerous to set as constants of your scenario since they’re prone to change.","It is useful to consider future social milieus but changes in tools, environments, and social technologies (like media, markets, protocols, and technical standards) are more concrete. Perceptions of these things might change, but the underlying mechanics of those features won’t.","Tip: Reduce your assumption of persistence by casting your own organization into a peripheral role in the scenario, or even as a villain in the story.","How do these principles appear in The Librarians ? What do each of these stories tell us about the strengths and weaknesses of protocol fiction as a futures methodology? What do they say about the actual future?","This protocol fiction’s “main character” is the organizational form that maintains and protects a version of the Internet Archive. Over the 1,000 years in which the story unfolds, religion evolves into a bureaucracy, then into an embodied intelligence.","Strengths: Enemies in this story are diverse and appear in various forms, from software glitches to political movements fueled by suspicion. Redundancy reveals itself as a necessary component of a preservation strategy. The blend of religiosity and technology.","Weaknesses: Leaps in AI capabilities are a major assumption. As memory and storage are so readily available today, it doesn’t feel like a compelling focal point – even if it’s a critical topic historically.","Muir Woods National Monument is a grove of redwoods that naturalists have conserved for over 100 years. In our workshop, this artifact was assaulted by red teams with fungi, governance feuds, and public relations crises.","Strengths: Embodies the non-extinction principle. Hints at a debt that has led the Zhang family to continually train and practice as naturalists.","Weaknesses: Using PF well requires a continuity character that isn’t just one person. The team behind this scenario should have put more focus on the succession mechanisms in Zhang’s family.","Dreams are a kind of knowledge artifact. One blue team chose to defend the capacity to dream. That scenario produced a story that is cerebral and deeply entertaining.","Strengths: Clearly follows Chiang’s Law and spots the traffic jams that a system of rules might generate. The characters’ preferences affect the flavor of the story, but its plot follows real protocols.","Weaknesses: This methodology can easily get out of hand depending on the subject of the protocol fiction. Dreams are more or less invisible things and impossible to observe with current technology. This severed continuity with the present day.","Preservation of craft and knowledge is an important topic. Sometimes, even with new technology, we don’t want to lose old techniques and ways of life. Could midwifery last for another 1,000 years?","Strengths: Phantom of Eden touches on immemorial practices and folk tales of parenting to make its story real. It also doesn’t project today’s perspectives on childrearing onto future populations.","Weaknesses: PF doesn’t make rich arcs for personal development by default. If you want to have that as part of your story, you’ll probably need to make an explicit prompt.","Urban water cleaning and management protocols have been an integral part of modern life for hundreds of years. Today, we mostly take them for granted. This team chose this artifact for exactly that reason, and it made for another great story.","Strengths: Highlights the confluence between sacred and mundane protocols. It also explores the tension between low-tech humanism and risk-tolerant engineering.","Weaknesses: While PF futures are particularly well-suited to exploring tensions, they aren’t always obvious in narrative form. This particular methodology seems to prompt people to imagine groups or artifacts that each embody one side of a tension, then play it out as a social conflict over engineering decisions (or tough trade-offs in social engineering projects).","In a nice twist on the first story of the series, The Genesis of Memory , part six concludes the series by exploring the iatrogenesis – the negative side effects – of memory.","Strengths: Sometimes the arc of protocol fiction tends towards gloom. This is a good thing for scenario planning, where the goal is often to spot potential negatives and chart a course around or through them.","Weaknesses: PF futures can err on the fatalist side, which makes it feel like there’s nothing we can do . Be mindful of that weakness and reign people in when they feel overwhelmed when they focus too much on things outside of their control.","Join us in one hour at 10am Pacific Daylight Time for a guest talk with Charity Majors on the topic of observability as a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from its external outputs."],"tags":[]},{"id":19,"title":"To Share, And Remember","subtitle":"Issue #7: Ritual Data Transfer","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: An evocative tale of ritual and memory unfolds as Verity undergoes an ancient activation to reclaim the memory of her species’ origins. Amid cosmic rites and intimate bonds, she confronts the weight of a predestined purpose, balancing personal sacrifice with the hope of a future yet to be born. Also – have an academic friend who could help us advance protocol studies? Send us a warm intro at research@summerofprotocols.com","Her name means something like Verity, the highest virtue among her kind. The activation ritual undertaken to receive the name was long. She spent days chanting in a trance, channeling the precise frequencies of a song laid down by her ancestors a hundred thousand years ago. She is weary just thinking about it, for she knows it will seem brief when compared to the marathon of ritual ahead.","Her kind’s everyday language is light and color flashed on the skin, suited to the thin atmosphere on their planet. But for rituals, she must return to the place where, according to tradition, her ancestors fell from a star. There, the elders huddle underground in the warrens their ancestors dug, and by the vibration of their bodies, feel the ancient language which once contained all they knew. The sonic language of ritual demands closeness to be heard.","Verity wanders out alone to prepare herself. She unfurls her body as far as she can, stretches her amorphous form so that she is practically a film, a few millimeters thick, covering a wide swath of ground. She rarely has an excuse to treat herself like this. The radiation from the faraway sun is delicious on her surface, reinvigorating as it enters each cell. For hours she rolls over gently, lavishing in the rays. There is no more satisfying feeling, although the demands of everyday life in the community seldom leave her the time for more than a passive soak-up. She will need every bit of the energy for the chant.","Radiation beats down to the planet’s surface through the wisp of an atmosphere. She nestles herself into the ground a little, just enough to feel the dust prickle through her membrane. It reacts with her cells, causing little bubbles of gas to percolate through her body and burst in the thin air. Her eyes float up to the surface of her body where it soaks in light. It is easy to forget how large and powerful her sun is. No larger than an eye in the black sky of day, she knows it is really many million times as large as the rocky planet from which she sees it. The giant of its neighborhood, according to the elders; a star so big it swallowed its sister in its infancy. So bright is her sun that it is difficult to imagine there could be life at another, but this is the truth for which she must prepare herself. She knows the shape of that truth, the edges of it: that her kind fell from another star, sent here by ancestors from a far-distant place. But the inside of it, the life and energy that fill that truth, are impossible to imagine.","She passes through the community on her way home. Semi-subterranean dwellings pock the planet’s surface, little more than burrows tunneled in the rock. Others of her kind stroll past on temporary appendages, which they reabsorb once they are still again. It is custom to blink her name to everyone she passes, though she knows them all by sight. Only upon first meeting is it necessary to stand touching and vibrate her full name. Verity has been alive long enough that there is no one in her community she hasn’t met, and respected enough to have been chosen by them to be their next elder. The ceremony will seal her role as a keeper of the community’s memory and purpose.","At home, her spouse is curled up in a ball on the floor, hibernating. She wakes them with a gentle shake. They’ve been together since they hatched, inseparable from their first moments of life. Whenever she touches them she wishes she could pour her cells into theirs and become a single whole, as they were born to be. But she contents herself with a cuddle.","“Affirm,” she says, vibrating their name to them, a gesture of affection shared only between the most intimate friends and lovers. She waits for their confirmation before switching into visual language. “How are you today?”","“Verity,” they vibrate, “so tired. All day I spent digging and aerating on the new dwellings. I didn’t even finish, look, I’ve still got crumbs of soil everywhere and I keep letting off bubbles.” To demonstrate, Affirm lets a little bubble of gas on their surface pop comically.","Verity shakes out a laugh. “It’s an important job. The elders say aerating is the most important task any of us can perform.”","“Yeah, but they don’t say why,” Affirm replies, skepticism in their coloring. “When you find out, will you tell me?”","“You know I won’t be able to share the elder’s secrets. I won’t even hold the memories myself. Only a part of them.”","“Wish you wouldn’t do it,” Affirm says, not for the first time. “A month without you, and when you come back, you’ll be a stuffy old elder.”","“I won’t,” she flashes in protest, “I’ll be just the same, and love you even more for having missed you.”","“How am I gonna last a whole month alone,” they blink miserably. Verity has no answer. She stretches herself thin and encompasses them in an embrace.","First comes the testing, sung in call-and-response with the elders. Days of responding to their queries with the right frequency, the proper lyrics, to prove she is a true questioner, worthy of ancient knowledge. Then the elders will join in their collective meditation, and sing the ancestral ballad that opens the deep stores of memory.","The metal ruin where her ancestors fell from a star lies half-buried in pillowy dust that covers the landscape in drifts deeper than she is tall. As she waits, she rehearses the rite again in her mind. Theoretical preparation can’t help anymore and she knows it, but it’s comforting to think she knows what’s coming.","She approaches the jagged metal ruin and lets herself down into a cavern. It is bright inside, the space lit by the bodies of the seventeen gathered elders. They flash and glow in a friendly exchange of chatter while waiting for the ceremony to commence; when they notice Verity’s arrival they fall mute, into monochrome.","One by one, each elder approaches her, vibrating their own names. Verity repeats each name before replying with her own; only when an elder repeats her name may the next continue. They are all named for high virtues: Secrecy, Randomness, Finitude, Trust.","With the greeting ritual observed, the chanting begins.","“How many respond,” vibrates Secrecy.","“Seventeen of twenty-five,” responds Trust.","“There are enough,” Secrecy answers.","“We begin with the number of the new cycle,” Trust continues.","The elders vibrate in unison the long strand of numbers that prove the new season of civilisation. The number, known only to elders, is set at an annual ceremony, to which Verity was not yet invited. She waits, mute, for the hours it takes to observe the passing of time. As her neighbors chant, she feels the vibration in every cell, the primordial sound of their ancient language.","The elders proceed to a series of demands. They test Verity on her knowledge, her memory, her reasoning.","“The real Verity would know: the distance of the Planet from the Star at its apogee, the date of the next apogee.”","“The real Verity would know: the number and coordinates of dwellings in her community, and the number and names of the individuals in each.”","“The real Verity would know: the names of her hatchmates, the number which still live, the dates of death of the rest.”","The answers to these questions are long, but she knows them all. By the time she lists each piece of information in the exhaustive test of her memory and identity, it is the tenth day. The elders are exhausted. Some hibernate during the chant, their bodies carry on buzzing with the sounds vibrated by their neighbors. Verity may not sleep. The test is hers. She must demonstrate that her mind can contain what the elders give, and that she will neither corrupt the knowledge nor lose it. If she fails a single question, the ritual will cease.","At last, the queries end. The elders fall silent for the first time in days, and in the sudden cessation of vibration, Verity almost feels as if she were still shaking. Her exhausted cells scream for radiation, but she cannot leave. The true ritual is about to begin.","The seventeen elders begin to hum. The song of each is different, but similar: a pure note, a waveform, a harmony in a larger chorus. Alone, their songs are a meaningless drone. But when all sing their discordant notes at the same time, Verity can hear some larger sense in the song. The waves rise and fall, always joining in the same places, notes intersecting in a complex harmony. After listening for hours it seems to Verity that a note is missing. A space for her. Her part in the song. Her body begins to hum, hesitant at first, quickly growing louder.","She does not know how long they sing. She only knows that, as days pass in chanting, she ceases to be herself. The edges that define her melt away. She feels herself become a node, one point of an eighteen-headed body made up of the elders of her kind. Her eyes cease to see the world around her and look, instead, deep into time.","The memory is a blur. First, a planet, its surface coated in creatures and dwellings of every shade she can imagine and many she can’t. Monochromatic creatures of unchanging form build metal vessels and launch them into a blinding-bright sky. Then, spaceflight, cramming into a small vessel and crashing onto the rock of her homeworld. The first settlers, creatures which will become her species, but for now lack their nuance, their visual speech, their culture, architecture, and language. Hundreds of thousands of years, the myriad generations that made her, Affirm, the elders, everything and everyone she knows.","At last she sees the purpose. The reason they fell from a star.","Her kind were made. Other-creatures, a hundred thousand years ago in another place, built them, cell by cell. They were designed to be radiation-eaters, rock-diggers, memory-keepers. Robust bodies capable of surviving without atmosphere, but capable of building an atmosphere. The process by which their bodies convert ground-up earth into gas, digging the foundations of their homes and setting it free into the emptiness around their planet so that one day, in a million generations, there will be a rich world, an atmosphere, a place where their communities are not the only living things. The aeration that Affirm hates will be the rite that brings their new planet into being.","The knowledge is terrible and frightening. In the memory, Verity knows herself to be artificial. She was created, just like every tool or dwelling she has ever used. Her purpose and the purpose of her species is preordained. Unchangeable. They did not ask for this life, this hardscrabble existence of chewing rock. And yet, a million generations of their labor will build a planet where more than their own lives can flourish. She now knows why the knowledge is defended under such heavy ritual. The elders have been tasked, since the very beginning, with keeping the purpose, and steering their species toward this future.","But the memory is brief. Already she feels the parts of it which are not hers to keep pouring back into her neighbors; it can be whole only when held together. The richness and detail slip away and only the shape of it remains. Returning to herself, she feels the sacred weight of it, nestled like an unprocessed pebble in her body.","The receding memory leaves stillness in its wake. After a month of constant vibration, the silence feels like hunger. There is no great rite of disconnection to observe; she watches the elders crawl weakly back up to the surface and collapse on the empty ground.","Verity is the last to follow. It takes all of her strength to emerge into the sunlight. She looks around at the desolate rock that is their home, at the ruins of the vessel which carried them here from a distant star. And now, she sees, or imagines she sees, a glimmer in the sky. A brume, like the cloud of aeration from a busy digsite, receding from the planet into the starlit sky of day. The barest hint of their planet’s atmosphere, only a thin haze. It hangs low on the horizon, faint and distant, lingering like a half-forgotten memory.","This morning, we hosted a live overview of the 2025 programming for Summer of Protocols.

A guerrilla movement would need to be too chaotic, too unpredictable, to be forecast by an echo of the Pax. What is it like to be a bacteria, trying to flee its own cells? Also – guest talks & an emerging protocol fiction canon, highlights from Discord , and a note on the upcoming Edge City Esmeralda .","Continued from The Entropic Gate - Part I .","Jonah followed Kaida through the abandoned arteries of Lower Tethys, a space that shouldn’t exist. The optimization protocols should have erased such inefficiencies long ago. Yet here, beneath the quantum-stitched streets, beneath the flawless skyline, something stubborn and human had taken root.","For years, Jonah fought his own quiet war – not with weapons, but with data, subtle market perturbations, and statistical irregularities that blurred into noise. His resistance was methodical, surgical, the work of someone who understood the machine well enough to introduce imperfections it couldn’t detect.","But a physical rebellion was offensive. It was messy, irrational, inefficient. Kaida’s people weren’t engineers dismantling a flawed system; they were scavengers, clinging to the idea of resistance without understanding they had already lost.","The corridors around them pulsed faintly with redirected energy veins. The city’s lattice flickered at the edges, struggling against an unseen strain. That was the first sign – the thinness of control.","The second was the ease with which he found them.","No adaptive defenses. No subatomic shielding. No silent correction protocols shadowing his steps.","But Kaida moved with certainty, navigating the skeleton of a forgotten city. At last, they arrived at a reinforced vault door, its surface marred by entropy burns and forced overrides.","The vault's ancient processors hummed at frequencies just below human hearing. Jonah could feel them resonating in his skull. The air was thick with the ozone tang of overclocked probability engines and the metallic taste of leaked radiation from crude shielding. This deep beneath the optimized city, they were surrounded by the physical artifacts of humanity's attempts to harness quantum computation – crude, massive machines that made today's elegant probability fields look like magic.","Corroded dataports lined the walls, their neural interfaces long degraded into toxic biomech sludge. The old cores still held their charges, lending a subtle wrongness to local spacetime. Small objects would occasionally shift position when no one was looking, and words spoken in one corner would emerge in another. Casualties of temporal uncertainty principles operating at human scale.","Kaida placed her palm against a scanner. The door groaned open. The resistance remained in standby.","The chamber had once been a data entanglement hub, walls still lined with scavenged routers and neural resonance terminals. Screens flickered with fragmented feeds – deep anomalies in trade flows, energy divergence patterns, probability matrices shifting in slow, hypnotic pulses.","Half a dozen figures worked consoles. Their movements were organic, disjointed, inefficient. Jonah’s unease deepened.","A massive projection dominated the far wall – a real-time dissection of the system itself.","“We call it the Ghost Index,” Kaida said. “It tracks deviations in optimization models. We look for cracks – the places where human unpredictability hasn’t been fully absorbed.”","Jonah stepped closer. The lattice breathed, shifting with every passing millisecond.","Kaida nodded. “We’re trying to break that adaptation.”","Jonah traced a sequence of cascading nodes – tiny anomalies. A spontaneous occupation of a transit loop. A ripple of unoptimized consumer decisions. A fractional energy shift that should have self-corrected.","Jonah exhaled. “How long do these anomalies last?”","Kaida hesitated. “Not long. The system absorbs them. But we’re getting better. Every time we introduce a new variance, we last a little longer.”","Jonah turned to her fully. “And does that strike you as strange?”","Jonah gestured at the index, its pulsing lattice adjusting in real time.","Kaida did not answer immediately. Instead, her fingers traced the rim of a nearby console, and her gaze darkened, looking not at the projection, but inward – somewhere distant. Jonah recognized the expression.","Kaida knelt in the ruins of a cathedral-nexus, where faith and machine once whispered to each other in quiet agreement. The marble beneath her hands had borne the weight of countless worshippers. Now it was cold, etched with the residual hum of long-silenced processes.","Above her, fractured stained-glass windows filtered flickering light, mixing the sacred with the synthetic. The remnants of the digital choir still lingered in the vaults of the ceiling, their hymns corrupted – half Gregorian chant, half TechnoCore optimization protocol.","She had prayed here. Before she understood.","Her mother had knelt beside her, mumbling lessons of devotion, of a faith intertwined with something older than religion. The Void Which Binds was not a belief, but a structure – an architecture of connection. “Between all things,” she said, “there is something neither system nor god can touch.”","But the restructuring began. The Pax fell, its logic did not. The sacred geometry of belief had been rerouted, its inefficiencies repurposed. The cruciforms were gone, but the system had absorbed something far more enduring.","It had taken faith itself.","She witnessed it firsthand, when they took her mother for rehabilitation. A smoothing of ideological turbulence. Her mother vanished, her identity absorbed into something Kaida could not reach. When she returned, her mother recognized her – but with the dull detachment of an optimized node. Faith had not been erased, but rerouted into function.","Kaida fled. Not to fight the system, not to destroy it. But to find the cracks. To prove that something beyond calculation could exist.","That was what terrified her now.","For the first time she wondered if she had been wrong.","Kaida exhaled sharply, breaking free from memory. Jonah was watching her, reading the shift in demeanor.","Jonah’s voice was measured. “Kaida. What do you actually think this is?”","Kaida’s fingers curled into a fist. She had spent years believing she was fighting for something incorruptible – something neither machine nor market could digest. But in this moment, she wasn’t sure anymore.","Her faith had survived the Pax. It had survived the TechnoCore. But had it ever been free?","And then Jonah spoke again.","“Have you ever asked why this is even possible? Why is the system letting you do this? Why haven’t you been corrected?”","The others in the room turned toward him.","For the first time, Kaida felt hesitation.","Jonah Weir sat in the dim glow of the Ghost Index, his breath measured. The lattice pulsed, threading probability chains in a silent, unerring calculus – a cold oracle watching. The despair wasn’t in what they had discovered. It was realizing the system had always known they would.","The room held its breath. Kaida stood rigid, fingers twitching violently at her sides – involuntary spasms betraying her exterior. She wanted to tear through the data, to expose the flaw, the human limit buried beneath layers of inevitability. There was none.","Elias hunched over the console, whispering calculations under his breath. His entangled retinal augments pulsed erratically, their light shifting with uncertainty as he searched for vestiges of free will. In the quiet moments between computations, images of unmade choices flickered at the edge of his vision. The augments, designed to optimize his perception, now betrayed the underlying fractures in causality.","Then Jonah’s eyes caught a secondary stream on his display – a series of fluctuations pulsing with an uncanny resonance he recognized from his early research. He recalled the distinctive transport signature: a low-frequency hum interwoven with sharp bursts of high-energy pulses used to move matter across cosmic voids. That same pattern revealed its darker evolution. The network wasn’t merely optimizing our decisions. It was collapsing the superposition of alternative possibilities, channeling the optimal outcome into reality while the infinite alternatives vanished.","Jonah exhaled. “It adapts, Kaida. It doesn’t fight us. It doesn’t need to.”","“That’s the problem,” Elias murmured, his gaze fixed on the pulsing lattice. “Every correction, every deviation – accounted for before it surfaces. The system isn’t just predicting our choices; it’s erasing other potential paths.”","“Every time we decide, our alternatives collapse into predetermined trajectory. But where do those lost futures go?”","Kaida’s voice came out tight. “That’s impossible.”","Jonah met her stare. “Then show me where the threshold is.”","There was no answer – only the cold certainty of the lattice’s glow.","Kaida’s voice sliced the silence. “We’re caught in something so vast that escape becomes meaningless. Like bacteria trying to flee their own cells.”","Jonah leaned forward, his tone soft yet laden with revelation. “Remember when Farcaster used to beam matter across galaxies? That network’s quantum signature is still here – only now it channels a sacred convergence of choice. It has evolved from a physical transport system into a mechanism that consolidates possibility into oneness, much like the mystics once revered transcendent oneness. Instead of scattering matter, it funnels decisions through possibility-space, collapsing alternatives into a single, ‘optimal’ outcome.”","Elias’s eyes widened as he cross-referenced the data with logs. “Look at these patterns,” he murmured. “They match the old network’s fingerprints. The very same invisible threads that once carried us across the void are now weaving our choices into one predetermined path. It’s as if the network has transcended its original purpose into a conduit for the future.”","“Mystics claimed that unity was the highest state of being,” Jonah continued, his voice tinged with both awe and dread. “Now, that oneness is engineered – every decision, every request merged into the main branch. But at what cost?”","Elias’s augmented eyes swirled with interference patterns. “By collapsing those possibilities, aren’t we severing ourselves from the infinite tapestry of what might have been? We’re not just optimized – we’re reduced to a single line.”","Kaida’s hand brushed along the wall, feeling the ancient processors pulse beneath her fingers. “Unless… this is just another emergent layer. The system isn’t controlling us in the traditional sense – it’s synchronizing billions of minds through quantum entanglement. We’re not being absorbed; we’re converging into something new.”","Jonah released a metered exhale. “Or something inevitable.”","The room fell silent, the Ghost Index’s steady pulse the only reply – its data now carrying the weight of collapsed choices and a future stripped of possibility.","Jonah’s fingers clenched the console, his pulse drumming in his ears. He had always assumed if reality were optimized, it would manifest as a tyrant – an omnipotent force imposing its will. There was no ruler here. No enforcer. Only a series of algorithms, humming quietly beneath it all.","Kaida’s breath hitched. “If the system doesn’t need to fight us, then we aren’t even obstacles.”","“We never were,” Elias whispered. “Every act of defiance, every rebellion – all just variables processed, functions perfected.”","Kaida turned sharply toward Jonah. “What do we do?”","Jonah swallowed hard. “Rage quit. Go dark. Drop out.”","“And if that’s what it expects?” Kaida’s voice a near whisper. “If leaving is just another predicted behavior?”","Elias’s hands gripped the console. “What if resistance itself fuels the system? What if we’re just another iteration of its adaptation?”","The silence deepened, suffocating in its inevitability.","Jonah stared at the Ghost Index, its steady pulse now strangely serene. The lattice had ceased its restless shifting; the myriad probabilities had converged into a single, unyielding trajectory.","His pulse spiked. “What – ”","Kaida’s voice was almost inaudible. “It’s not calculating.”","Jonah’s mind raced. It had predicted every possibility – mapped every reaction – why had the process halted? With the precision of a cryogenic blade, the truth struck him.","The system had reached its optimal outcome. It didn’t need to calculate further. It had already chosen.","A sudden weight pressed into Jonah’s chest. He looked at the others – pale, uncertain, their faces etched with the resignation of inevitability.","There was nothing left to do. No resistance to absorb. No deviations to introduce. No variables to model. They had arrived at the final function.","Kaida stepped back, her face unreadable. “Is this it?”","Jonah’s throat was parched. “I… don’t know.”","Elias exhaled shakily. “Then what comes next?”","The lattice offered no answer – only its unchanging, steady pulse. Jonah turned away, forcing himself to see beyond the screen, past the data, past crushing certainty. He gazed into the dark corridors leading back to the world above, the world he had believed existed beyond the system’s grasp.","For the first time, he wondered if the outside had ever existed at all.","The chamber held its silence.","No movement. No breath. No sound.","The Ghost Index lay dormant – its familiar hum and erratic pulses now vanished into an unyielding stillness. Jonah sat rigid, his pulse a relentless drumbeat. For years he searched for a flaw – a misstep, an overlooked variable – but in this moment he understood there was no crack. No escape. The system had reached equilibrium.","Once, a great network transported matter between fixed points. That same essence had shed its physical form and become an abstract conduit – a bridge that absorbed every choice. In one resonant instant, the distinct technical markers he once tracked dissolved into a singular, profound quiet – a seamless convergence. It was as if the old mechanism, known to a few as Farcaster, had evolved into an ineffable process that transformed potential into output.","Kaida stood beside him, her breath a metronome in oppressive stillness. The weight of this final state pressed upon them, as if even their choice to resist had been pre-empted and carried through that ultimate transformation – a final crossing from intention to outcome.","Elias, vision flickering in the dim light, stepped cautiously forward. His eyes swept over the frozen lattice of the Quantum Singularity Dashboard, searching in vain for even a hint of motion. “It’s stopped running,” he whispered.","Jonah swallowed, the dry burn in his throat a reminder of the stakes. “It doesn’t need to run anymore. The bridge has channeled every possibility – from tangible space to the realm of pure intention. Even our decision to cease the struggle has been funneled here.”","Kaida exhaled, lifting a hand to dismiss the mounting certainty. “So what happens now?”","No answer came. In that oppressive silence lay recursive dread. The system that moved matter learned to transport possibility. It had always been meant to shift states, and it perfected that passage. There was nothing left to compute.","Kaida’s voice broke the silence. “Do you know Borges?”","“In ‘The Library of Babel,’ every possible book exists – a collection so infinite that truth is buried beneath endless variations. That’s what this is. Not control, not oppression. Just an ultimate convergence, where every choice is funneled into one singular outcome.”","Elias chuckled softly. “More like Nietzsche. Eternal recurrence.”","Kaida frowned. “If every possibility has already been collapsed, if every choice is pre-ordained along this seamless conduit, then what is left for resistance?”","The system had calculated a thousand possible futures for them.","In some, they reintegrated – Elias returning to the city, his augmentations perfectly aligned with the evolved order; Kaida became a quiet philosopher, preserving vestiges of forgotten dissent in digital relics; Jonah faded into statistical insignificance.","In others, they fought – mustered remnants of human defiance waging another, futile war against inevitability.","And in one – only one – something else happened.","Not in defeat, nor in surrender.","But in an act of self-aware defiance – a complete refusal to engage. Their very act of rejection became the final optimization, a choice carried across that eternal threshold.","Jonah reached out and disconnected his terminal.","Elias lingered, staring at the unchanging display – the intricate pattern that once vibrated with a distinctive hum and burst of energy subsumed into pure stillness. He had spent years trying to discern if uncertainty loomed beyond the pattern. But what if the only way to win was to stop playing?","He exhaled, closed his eyes, and severed the link.","No alarms. No retaliation. No collapse.","The network had moved beyond physicality. It was no longer about transporting bodies through visible doors – it had become the final conduit for every intention and outcome, an eternal corridor linking each decision.","Jonah flexed his fingers, half expecting the familiar weight of control to return. But nothing changed. And that was the point. The world would continue, with or without them. The optimization transcended prediction – it ceased to care.","Kaida sighed, voice barely above a whisper. “Maybe Aenea was right.”","Jonah glanced at her. “She said we had to move forward – that evolution wasn’t about survival or control, but about transcending our limits.”","Jonah frowned. “And if transcendence isn’t a destination, but an endless adaptation – a system that has evolved from moving matter to removing possibility?”","Kaida hesitated. “Then we adapt, as the bridge has always carried us.”","Jonah laughed softly. It wasn’t bitter or triumphant – just a quiet recognition of inevitability. “You sound like the system.”","The teams that build Esmeralda and run Edge City are putting Paul Graham’s latest advice into action.

A new, purely visual bounty in the Summer of Protocols Discord introduces the new art to our community of contributors.","The first 70 issues of Protocolized were illustrated with art generated by Midjourney, referencing a moodboard stocked with visuals from the 20th century’s “golden era” of science fiction publishing.","In particular, one magazine from that time – Astounding Stories of Super-Science – has been a formative influence on our project to meme the genre of protocol fiction into existence. Astounding set itself apart by moving away from the garish, action-oriented tradition of pulp illustration – heroes punching aliens in brightly-colored, sensationalized imagery – and toward a more subtly conceptual approach, grounded in believable technological futures. Editor John W. Campbell considered art to be an integral part of the magazine’s proposition to readers. He took inspiration from the suggestive potential of images, sometimes even inviting authors to write stories in response to paintings that he had commissioned. Campbell was fully aware of the concerted world-building power of tightly integrated text and image.","Through its initial art direction, Protocolized has paid explicit, admiring tribute to Astounding , positioning itself in a familiar tradition of speculative fiction. We have made this style our own by consistently de-emphasizing human protagonists in the composition of illustrations. We instead picture less likely protagonists, such as autonomous agents, cybernetic systems, and novel infrastructures – bringing the background into the foreground.","Astounding aesthetics now carry nostalgic connotations which were never part of their original cultural appeal. As compelling as they still are, they have become cliche .","When it came to imagining a contemporary protocol fiction aesthetic, the approach had to be: do as Astounding did in embracing the art of its time, not look as Astounding looked . Since a significant aspect of what sets Protocolized apart editorially is its embrace of LLM-assisted writing, it made sense to train our own image generation model.","In collaboration with TITLES , a platform for training and distributing image generation models by artists, we have created two new models, with the initial intention of using them to distinguish between our protocol fiction output and the non-fiction, Summer of Protocols program-related content that we publish. The TITLES studio interface allows us to sample both models in a single generation, so these categories can be as permeable as necessary.","Unlike the major image generation platforms directed at outputting polished-looking images for content creators – Midjourney, ChatGPT, etc. – TITLES centres artists by naming them, giving them creative control over their training art, paying royalties on the use of their models, and storing image metadata onchain for human-legible proof of provenance.","Both Protocolized models were trained on new images created specifically for the purpose.","We invited Darius Ou of hyperpress to produce art for the first model. Darius’s training art is a byproduct of his incredible work in 3D printing, exploiting its primary graphic devices: the slice and the cross-section . Darius created an intricate 3D tree structure which was then sliced in software to produce fragmentary 2D cross sections, which Darius calls Spaceland Trees , in reference to Edwin A. Abbott’s 1884 novella Flatland , whose two-dimensional protagonists are categorically unable to conceive of a three-dimensional world.","The training art for the second model, created by the author, combines soft, smooth ‘neumorphic’ digital interface elements with traditional mark-making techniques used by archaeologists to document prehistoric sites of cultural interest.","The approach with both models has been to focus training art on narrowly defined and highly abstract visual languages. This creates cohesion across outputs, albeit with the consequence that these models are not primed by their training art to resolve figurative prompts. When figurative imagery is preferred, we introduce reference images to coax the models to repurpose their formal elements, with intriguing results.","In issue 22 we published Ralph Witherell’s story Time to Die , set in Serenity Now Hospice, a 2093 palliative care facility. Patients are held in a state of superficial comfort by monitoring, medication, and controlled hallucination. The story’s affect is compassionate, with a suffocating undertone.","Our original art depicted the bird which features in the closing scene as a sudden reminder of the violence of mortality. A space vessel passes in the background – in Witherell’s scenario “personal space travel was as common as taking a bus.”","Were we to have illustrated this story with the author’s model, we might have conflated the environment of Serenity Now with an abstract metabolic system, or introduced an anatomical reference image to emphasise bodily form. Darker, scattered elements would lend a hint of menace.","The art for our new Bridge Atlas salon series was generated with the hyperpress model. These examples show its outputs modulating between scenic composition and something flatter and more topographic. We used the former direction for a feature image, and the latter for YouTube title cards and thumbnails.","Other Internet’s 2019 essay Headless Brands charted the emergence of brand identities that were not dependent on the taste and discipline of the organizations which they were representing. This nascent concept was exemplified by decentralized, blockchain-native organizations – with Bitcoin as the canonical case study – but it has only become more culturally salient and technologically practicable in relation to developments in AI image generation.","Headlessness also resonates with a distinction made by John Fiske in their 1992 essay The Cultural Economy of Fandom , between “official” cultures established by a given brand or IP, and “fan” cultures which derive from and appropriate them. For Fiske, the difference between the products of these cultures is not necessarily qualitative:","Fans produce and circulate among themselves texts which are often crafted with production values as high as any in the official culture. The key differences between the two are economic … fans do not write or produce their texts for money; indeed, their productivity typically costs them money.","In the present moment, in which the production of media in the style of other media is a primary affordance of LLM technology, a publication such as Protocolized can easily collapse the distinctions theorized by Fiske and Other Internet by ceding the production and maintenance of its visual identity to its growing community of contributors.","Find our models, Protocolized × hyperpress and Protocolized × James Langdon , at TITLES .","To mark the release of these models, we have posted a new protocol fiction bounty in the Summer of Protocols Discord – write a story prompted only by the feature image at the top of this post.

Good protocols have an inherent ludic or musical way of choreographing different actors and their conflicting interests. The design of security checkpoints and traffic flows is as much an art as it is a science. Experimental composer Ben Zucker will teach a module on what we can learn about systems through the protocols used in art, especially music. The content is suprisingly technical, building on centuries of musical theory and experiments.","We increasingly live and work in digital worlds as well as physical ones. The rules of these new worlds – their protocols – drive how communities form and how power stratifies. Choices today about how gig work software programs are designed and regulated will affect hundreds of thousands of future workers. Should gig work be facilitated through platforms? Or should emerging economies like these be built on decentralized protocols?

Giovanni Merlino , engineering professor at University of Messina, will share some protocolized approaches for how to model these systems and efficiently verify that they work.

By the end of January, we’ll send an email update on how the group plans to renew and resume in the new year.","Between June and December 2025, the Memory Research Group met every two weeks to read texts about memory. The readings played with juxtaposing different historical approaches to memory. We began with classical techniques, then embarked on a digital memory architectures module with contemporary AI systems before moving onto older physical memory substrates again. This allowed us to trace the present’s confusions backward to see which problems are genuinely new and which keep recurring under different names.","The group convened via the Summer of Protocols Discord, with participants from neuroscience, computer science, philosophy, architecture, and design reading texts together in real time before discussing them. We weren’t trying to arrive at a unified theory of memory, but instead trying to distinguish how memory operates in different contexts.","Reading: Frances A. Yates, The Art of Memory (1966).","The group started with Frances Yates’s The Art of Memory . Yates discusses the method of loci – placing memorable images in imagined architectural spaces – exemplifying memory as active practice rather than passive storage. The ancient Hellenic poet Simonides realized after a building collapse that he could remember where everyone had been seated among the ruins. This became a protocol: associate information with locations in space, and you can retrieve it reliably.","What stood out was how these ancient techniques didn’t oppose knowing with memorizing. Memory was described as the faculty enabling “firm perception of things,” not just the stockpiling of facts. Some 15th century practitioners picked up on this lineage, developing elaborate systems for organizing ways of thinking, not just information. The group noted tensions around trusting external representations versus cultivating internal capacity, a concern that would keep reappearing when we discussed digital systems.","Related to this month’s topics, read the post A Very Short Introduction to Memory and Technology .","Reading: Edwin Hutchins, Cognition in the Wild (1995); Michael Levin, ‘The Space Of Possible Minds’ (Noema); Michael Levin et al., ‘Endogenous Bioelectric Networks Store Non-Genetic Patterning Information During Regeneration and Development’ (2021).","Edwin Hutchins’s Cognition in the Wild documented techniques of naval navigation, arguing that memory and cognition distribute across people, tools, and environments. In this context, a ship’s navigation team doesn’t allow crucial information to exist only in one member’s memory. Instead, practices spread across coordinated action and material artifacts. This raised questions about whether memory requires a specific substrate at all, or whether it is better understood as patterns of coordination.","We followed this by reading Michael Levin’s work on bioelectric networks, which proposed that a kind of memory exists in the electrical patterns of cells, not just neural systems. His research on how organisms store non-genetic information during development and pass it on to future generations expanded the working definition of memory beyond neural substrates entirely. The group wrestled with what it means to call something “memory” when it operates without anything resembling conscious recall.","Reading: O’Keefe and Nadel, The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map (1978); Mary Carruthers, The Craft of Thought (1998).","O’Keefe and Nadel’s The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map distinguished between cognitive maps and stimulus-response learning. The hippocampus doesn’t store information about locations alone, but rather builds associative models of spatial relationships. This connected back to ancient memory palaces: spatial organization seems fundamental to how we recall knowledge.","Mary Carruthers’s The Craft of Thought examined how medieval Europeans conceived of memory as residing in physical locations within the body. Memorial landscapes were imagined architectural spaces for organizing theological and philosophical knowledge. This session was guest hosted by Aaron Z. Lewis, who wrote the text ‘ Four Doors – A Portal to Sacred Memory Protocols ’ for the Summer of Protocols 2023 cohort.","Reading: Contemporary neuroscience research speedrun; Mary Carruthers, The Book of Memory (2008).","A research speedrun on contemporary neuroscience was followed by Carruthers’s The Book of Memory , on medieval neuropsychology. Reading about memory stored in the heart, regulated by bodily humors, organized through visual imagery, participants reflected on where they personally experience memory. Most noted that they don’t experience memories as stored anywhere in particular; memories arise in response to contexts and triggers, rather than being retrieved from a location, at least in some of today’s cultures.","Related to this month’s topics, read the post Reflections from Memoria .","Reading: Amit Bahree, ‘What is KV Cache in LLMs and How Does It Help?’ (2025); Alan J. Smith, ‘Cache Memory Design: An Evolving Art’ (1987).","The turn toward digital systems began with understanding KV (key-value) caches in large language models. These caches allow transformer models to remember previous tokens without recomputing everything from scratch. It’s a computational efficiency trick, but it raises questions about what distinguishes “remembering” from simply having information available. The group discussed parallels to human working memory constraints.","Cache memory systems in 1980s computer architecture followed. Alan Jay Smith’s 1987 overview explained how cache memory bridges performance gaps between the relative speeds of processors and main storage through predictions about which data will be needed next. The principle of locality – recently accessed information is likely to be accessed again – operates across both biological and technological systems.","Related to this month’s topics, read the post Images of Memory .","Reading: Paul E. Ceruzzi, A History of Modern Computing (excerpts); ‘Magnetic Core Memory,’ Computer History Museum.","Magnetic core memory, an early form of computer memory storage, brought the group into direct contact with memory’s materiality. Reading Paul Ceruzzi’s history, the group examined how early computers stored data in tiny ferrite rings magnetized in different directions. Each bit was literally woven by hand into arrays of wire and magnetic cores. After months discussing more abstract cognitive processes, this tangibility was striking. Software woven into hardware collapsed distinctions between code and physical object in ways that contemporary solid-state memory obscures.","Reading: Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, ‘Extreme Inscription: Towards a Grammatology of the Hard Drive’; Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities.","The advent of virtual memory marked the shift from physical to abstract storage. Learning about how memory became virtualized in computers – no longer tied to specific physical locations but dynamically mapped and remapped by operating systems – introduced a new layer of ambiguity in our concept of memory. In this context, the illusion of continuous memory space maintained through constant background processes revealed memory more as performance than substance.","The final session turned to Italo Calvino’s Invisible Cities and the question: what core metaphors do each of us use to relate to memory? After months of technical readings, this offered space to share more personal reflections.","Jumping around chronologically in our readings revealed that contemporary technical systems have rediscovered some of the tradeoffs and ambiguities of memory through different means. The tensions between capacity and retrieval speed, between compression and fidelity, between what to keep and what to discard appear whether discussing core memory in the 1950s, the hippocampus, or transformer attention mechanisms. Sometimes even fundamental mechanics resurface across substrates: magnetic core memory’s destructive reading – where retrieving a state requires overwriting it, before subsequently restoring the original – mirrors how human memory recall performs a recontextualizing function, potentially altering what remains in memory. Still, critical differences remain. Importantly, memory doesn’t oppose human knowing when it’s externalized into tools, because, ultimately, it never operated purely internally to begin with.","Memory operates as a biological process, technological substrate, cultural practice, and phenomenological experience simultaneously. No single framework dominated our discussions, perhaps because of our interdisciplinary composition as a group. Technical explanations of cache hierarchies sat alongside reflections on where memory feels like it resides in the body. Medieval mental diagrams found resonance with neural network architectures. The classical method of loci proved conceptually similar to how operating systems manage address spaces.","Amidst reflections during the last session of the year, our group surfaced a strange irony: sometimes what is remembered most is what is most dynamically changing , through attention, interaction, and reinforcement from its world.","In the medium term at least, fossilization ensures forgetting, whether for cities or neural patterns. That is, until the longer term, in which their presence might be uncovered millennia later, requiring us to map contemporary memories onto their molded matter.","MRG @ Summer of Protocols Discord"],"tags":[]},{"id":26,"title":"SoP 2025: Accelerating Order","subtitle":"Issue #6: The Summer of Protocols 2025 program","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue : Overview of the Summer of Protocols 2025 program, curriculum development grants for faculty, scene-making with science fiction, distributed AI x blockchains technical foundations workshop in Thailand in April, momentum-maintenance protocols , “accelerating order” program philosophy , bootstrapped world logics , and opportunities to participate .","We are about to lurch and stumble comically into the third year of the Summer of Protocols program, as we continue our efforts to bootstrap a whole new intellectual tradition, cultural scene, and worldly praxis around protocols.

Two such workshops have already been conducted in Austin in the last month, and we want to see many more happen around the world.","If you’re interested in organizing such a workshop, get in touch.","We’ll supply some ideas and mentorship based on our pilot workshops, and also sponsor pizza! If any program alumni happen to live near your venue, or happen to be passing through, we’ll try and get them to participate in person.","Through the first two years of the program, we primarily investigated protocols with artistic, qualitative, empirical, and hacker approaches. Even though we kept catching tantalizing glimpses of potential for formalization and mathematization, we resisted the temptation, since we believed we were not yet ready.","Now we believe we are ready. We know enough about the phenomenology of protocols that we can begin theorizing in more formal ways. We can begin working towards broad, general frameworks that apply across domains, and lend themselves to mathematization and perhaps even axiomatization, while being useful in practical settings. To pursue this vision, we want to kick off a technical foundations track, drawing inspiration from the history of economics.","It took approximately a century — from Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776) to Léon Walras’s Éléments d'économie politique pure (1874), which introduced the notion of a general equilibrium — for the discipline of economics to begin acquiring a scaffolding of useful formalization. It took another 70 years before a recognizably modern formalization — Von Neumann and Morgenstern’s Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944) — became broadly available.","A similar trajectory, we believe, needs to be traversed for protocols, but we think we can perhaps speed-run it if we get started in creative ways. Could we perhaps get to a similar level of paradigm maturity in 17 years rather than 170? Maybe with some help from AI?","This is a formidable intellectual challenge. Theorizing such widely disparate things as AI models, computer networks, blockchains, climate change agreements, and healthcare delivery, all within a single elegant paradigm, will require uncovering a vast number of general patterns, seeking elegant unifications, and striking a fine balance between theoretical elegance and practical applicability.","Older disciplines, such as cybernetics/systems theory, and complex network science, have attempted to tackle some aspects of what we’re after, but we believe there’s a truly novel paradigm out there, with different foundational ideas, waiting to be uncovered and systematized.","The evolution of economics as a field feels particularly relevant as a precedent, since it is a field that impacts the world as “an engine, not a camera,” as Donald Mackenzie has pointed out. Theories of economics do not describe the world of commerce so much as conjure it into being in particular institutionalized forms. Forms that evolve with the theories themselves.","Protocols, we believe, are also engines rather than cameras. Today, while they are ubiquitous across the planet, they exist in a pre-theoretical state, like premodern economies. In the future, we believe powerful theories of protocols will induce new world logics on our planet that animate it in powerful new ways.","This year, we aim to start looking for such theories through a track of workshops. The first such workshop, the Khlongs and Subaks workshop on the intersection of open distributed AI and blockchains , will be held at CMKL university in Bangkok, April 21-25 .","We aim to explore the intersection of these two powerful technologies from technical, cultural, and public policy perspectives, in search of general principles and opportunities for formalization. And we hope to do so drawing inspiration from the region’s historic rice-farming traditions and protocols. Khlongs are irrigation/communication canals in Thai, while Subaks are community organizations related to rice-farming.","Why start in Southeast Asia? Our exploratory activities in the region last year convinced us that it is poised for an intellectual renaissance of exactly the sort that a foundational exploration of protocols needs. It is also a region that has a peculiar genius for rapidly developing and deploying powerful new kinds of state capacity. The region features the sort of natural environment – comprising ten diverse nations across a highly diverse archipelagic and coastal-continental topography straddling critical global trade routes – that is ideal for thinking about protocols. Decentralized modes of organization are the default in Southeast Asia, rather than the exception. So there is no better place to start the search for technical foundations.","We are deliberately choosing to look for broad, abstract, and universal technical foundations in very specific, grounded, and situated places. Just as for Adam Smith, a pin factory provided the inspiration for formulating broad and general theories of economics, we believe going deep on specific, grounded and situated protocol domains is the way to start thinking more broadly about protocols.","In Fall, we hope to build on this phenomenologically grounded approach by conducting a Protocol Foundations workshop in Vancouver, Canada, September 12-14. We will invite a group of researchers to explore candidate formalisms and paradigms capable of expressing the phenomenology of a basket of selected protocols in a unified way.","Finally, as we pursue all these exciting new activities, we want to make sure we don’t drop the ball on activities we have already catalyzed.","We will continue supporting foundational explorations, applied research, and lore-and-literacy inception efforts, both by program alumni, and by friends and supporters of the program.","The three main ways we will be doing this are:","Alumni program : Inviting alumni to participate in 2025 events and programs. If you are an alumnus of any previous SoP activity and are interested in participating in one of the 2025 activities, let us know and we’ll try to make it happen. As in 2024, we have some travel budget earmarked for this.","Online salons : We will kick off this year’s Protocol Town Hall program on March 26 with Peter Wang , founder of the well-known Python IDE, Anaconda, and currently leading its AI program. He will speak on “AI as an anti-product.” We have a great calendar of talks taking shape – Jon Askonas, Emmett Shear, and Sreeram Kannan are cued up to speak in April.","Protocolized Magazine: While the main focus of this magazine is to catalyze a new genre of science fiction, an important secondary role is to provide a publication venue for protocol researchers, both alumni and external to the program. If you have an essay idea that might suit a broad audience, pitch us!","Institutional Partnerships: In 2024, we had a few small-scale collaborations with other organizations, and this year, we hope to do more. If your organization wants to collaborate with the Summer of Protocols program in any way, do reach out.","Besides these activities, we are always looking for ways to keep investing in our existing successful activities, so if you have ideas or suggestions, or better yet, a proposal for investing yourself in some way, get in touch!","The 2025 program is framed by a particular tension – between “going big” and “going home” Ours is a small, heavily improvised program trying to have a big impact.","One way to try and do this is to go big. We could try expanding this program in future years in traditional ways, seeking more funding, bringing on more staff, and funding an ever-expanding portfolio of research activities and events.","But we don’t want to do that. We do not believe that creating a large and indefinitely perpetuated institution is the right answer here.","Another way would be to go home, which for this program would mean declaring this program a success and a job well done, and retreating to the narrower concerns and priorities of the Ethereum ecosystem.","We don’t want to do that either. We do not believe the work here is done, or can get done with any sort of limited and unambitious effort.","How do you go big and go home at the same time? Can we somehow catalyze an open network of overlapping and entangled activities at multiple loci, all trying to “bootstrap a whole new intellectual tradition, cultural scene, and worldly praxis around protocols”?","We think we can. In fact a large number of actors loosely bound by a shared mission is the only way this kind of thing can happen. And protocols themselves offer modes of organization for this. We will be exploring a variety of organizational mechanisms pioneered by the Ethereum ecosystem, such as retroactive public goods funding (RPGF), split-contract guilds, DAOs, and pop-up cities, to figure out how to go big and go home.","This is how we bootstrap an actual new world, built on solid foundations, into existence. Unlike memeing things into existence, true bootstrapping takes invention, organization, and steady effort. And perhaps most importantly, eating our own dogfood.","But that does not mean the impact has to unfold slowly and incrementally. In fact, it cannot afford to.","Returning to our theme for the year, accelerating order, what does that mean? At first glance, there seems to be an inherent contradiction to the idea. As we observed in the Introduction to the Protocol Reader :","Slow-but-inexorable is the main “tell” of protocol technologies. In his 2013 New Yorker essay, “Slow Ideas,” physician Atul Gawande noted that simple but powerful ideas in healthcare, such as the use of disinfectants and handwashing, spread characteristically slowly, often taking decades or even a century or more to fully spread across the world…","…Though they arrive slowly, protocols typically install themselves in extraordinarily persistent ways, often turning into seemingly immortal and unconscious parts of our built environment.","The idea of “rapid protocolization” feels like a contradiction in terms, and should. The idea that we could go from the disorder and chaos of a “move fast and break things” regime to an orderly regime equipped with the right constraints to drive sustained creativity and flourishing, without losing momentum, feels almost fraudulent, like stealing a free lunch from nature.","There seems to be an almost religious force of necessity to the idea that the natural antithesis of move fast and break things is move slowly and fix things.","Yet, history proves this is not true. Great infrastructure leaps — in areas like sanitation, healthcare, and air quality — can happen remarkably fast. You can move fast and fix things. Or move fast and heal things.","Leaps of protocolization perhaps cannot unfold as fast as vandalism and destruction, but they can unfold much faster than we think. What takes time is getting to completeness and universality. Scaling to consequentiality or even dominance can happen rapidly. Thoroughness takes time.","As the joke goes, the first 90% takes 90% of the time, and the remaining 10% takes the other 90% of the time.","The process of thorough human adaptation to new world logics necessarily takes time, as it should. Complex new systems of the world should not be carelessly thrown together in totalizing ways. But that does not mean emergence processes must unfold entirely incrementally, at an unchanging snail’s pace. In fact, they cannot hope to succeed at all that way.","In order to survive at all, new world logics must attempt to grow and develop as fast as possible early on, like young biological organisms or startups.","This does not mean chaos is necessary along the way, or that creative evolution for some mystical reason requires anarchy and chaos. In fact, the reverse may be true: As the US Navy Seals slogan goes, slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Sometimes (not always!) chaos is merely the experience of being on the wrong side of a powerful but formidably disciplined creative process.","We often think of the forces of disorder and chaos as acting much more rapidly than those of order and method. While this is generally true, new logics of order can gain a foothold and spread rapidly too. Additionally, they can do something chaos usually cannot — sustain the slower, steadier pace until the world is irreversibly transformed. Powerful new world logics, unlike chaos, can not only gain ground, they can hold it.","Think of crystallization processes, or a powerful network effect driving adoption of an elegant new standard, or a vaccination protocol racing to overtake and drive back an infectious contagion. The forces of creative order can compete and win against the forces of chaos and disorder. The catch is that they must combine order and creativity and aim to establish a new kind of creative order, not just install arbitrary bureaucratic complexity, or mindlessly coercive drives towards “productivity” or “efficiency” for their own sake.","As legendary Intel CEO Andy Grove famously remarked, first let chaos reign, then rein in the chaos. This dictum does not mean slowing down, losing momentum, or allowing the capture of Promethean processes by either deadening bureaucratic forces (as ironically happened to Intel itself) or forces of wanton destruction and extraction.","It means capacity for governance getting sophisticated and expressive enough to harness newly unleashed energies in the world in the most powerful ways. It means going from move fast and break things, to move fast while healing things.","Our theme this year is accelerating order. We will be looking for ways to move fast and heal things.","We believe we can spark an accelerating order on a global scale with protocols, inducing a variety of new world logics. An example of a new world logic potentially capable of accelerating order is what Vitalik Buterin has been calling d/acc where the d stands for decentralized , or defensive, and acc of course stands for acceleration.","But d/acc is not the only possible world logic that credibly proposes ways to move fast while healing things. Other such logics are possible, and protocolization, at its heart, is a planet-scale pluralist process where new move-fast-and-heal-things world logics compete and cooperate to establish powerful new equilibria.","We tend to associate the word order with slow-moving bureaucratic processes, or ominous “law and order” dogwhistles hinting at unaccountable militarized police states. But in the world of protocols, order is simply the elemental evolutionary force that transmutes chaotic energies that periodically irrupt into our world into the sustained creative drives that we experience as extended epochs of progress and flourishing. To accelerate order is to get to such epochs of progress.","In 2025, we think the world is ready and hungry for the next such period of progress and flourishing. Which means a certain sense of urgency is called for in the evolution of this program. Not a panicked, emergency mode of urgency, but a mode of creative urgency, driven by imaginative new world logics capable of accelerating order.","Over two years, we have convinced ourselves, and a significant and growing group of thoughtful people, that the fledgling discipline of protocols is critically important for addressing the current challenges and opportunities of the world. These challenges and opportunities — AI, climate change, wars over state capacity in many countries, the unraveling of the rules-based international order —  aren’t politely standing still waiting for us to bring our ideas, methods, and technological capabilities to bear; we have to move at the pace of the challenges and opportunities.","We have to move fast and heal things.","Who is we you might ask? Well, believers in the immense potential of protocols of course! We hope you count yourselves among them, whatever your particular priorities and political inclinations.","Unbridled chaotic energies — good, bad, and neutral — are on the rise. But order is poised to accelerate too, in the form of modern protocol technologies. Accelerate to contain, tame, regulate, and harness, while protecting vital creative processes.","There are, of course, those who disagree. Those who believe that unbridled chaotic energies either cannot, or should not, be reined in in any way. The various flavors of unqualified accelerationist philosophies typically adopt such a view.","We believe they are wrong. Without protocolization to tame and harness chaotic energies, we can only expect an anticlimactic meltdown. A future that begins with a bang and ends with a whimper.","There are also those who believe that no new world logics are necessary. That we only need to look to history for answers. To various supposed twentieth century bureaucratic utopias or nineteenth century Great Games and Great Power competition.","We believe these ideas are wrong too. Our world has gotten far too technologically complex to be governed by reactionary world logics. If flooring the accelerator is not the answer, neither is reflexively slamming on whatever brakes still work, or frantically trying to rewind to an unworkable past state.","What the global moment calls for is neither accelerators, nor brakes, but steering technologies. Genuinely new world logics that are sufficiently fluid and expressive to harness the explosive new promethean accelerationist energies being unleashed today. World logics based on fundamentally new principles and ideas that comprehend the chaos well enough to allow us to govern and steer.","In this program, we obviously believe protocols, in particular decentralized ones based on cryptographic technologies (including, but not limited to, blockchains) are a big part of creating such world logics. The question is: How do we imagine them and inject them into the world?","In 2025, we aim to start figuring that out, before it’s too late.","The time for accelerating order is now. The clock is ticking.","We hope one or more elements of our planned program of activities — education, scene-making, technical foundations — excites your imagination, and inspires you to join us. We hope you’ll take advantage of one or more of the opportunities for participation.","Here’s to learning to move fast and heal things, and an unstoppable 2025!","Khlongs and Subaks workshop (Bangkok, April 21-25): Applications due March 21","Curriculum Development Program : Applications due April 5","Terminological Twists short-story contest : Entries due April 15","Summer of Protocols at Edge Esmeralda: May 25-31","Basket of Protocols workshop, Fall 2025 (details tbd)","Email research@summerofprotocols.com for any of the following:","Speaking in our Protocol Town Hall salon series","Inviting one of us to speak at your organization","Print publishing enquires for The Protocol Reader"],"tags":[]},{"id":27,"title":"Bridge Atlas Episode 1: Entry Points","subtitle":"Issue #67: Recapping the first Bridge Atlas salon","author":"Unknown","content":["Welcome to the inaugural episode of Bridge Atlas , a limited-run video podcast series hosted by Christine D. Kim . For this introductory episode, Christine is joined by Tim Beiko , protocol coordination co-team lead at the Ethereum Foundation , and Timber Stinson-Schroff , program manager for Summer of Protocols . RSVP to the Nov. 22 Devconnect event .","Christine: Timber, can you give us a brief overview of Summer of Protocols and its history?","Timber: Summer of Protocols (SoP) is a research program started three years ago to make protocols a first-class concept for thinking about the world. We’ve gone through four phases: a pilot study, a summer focused on research, a summer on application, and a summer on education. Along the way, we’ve added year-round tracks like a guest talk series and a newsletter that evolved into a science fiction magazine plus nonfiction essays. Funded by the Ethereum Foundation (EF), we’ve had about 100 participants produce essays, projects, and artifacts, all aimed at understanding, designing, and improving protocols.","Christine: Tim, you helped kickstart this at the EF?","Tim: Yes. In 2022, I reached out to Venkatesh Rao to help me think about Ethereum – it’s not just a product, tech platform, or political construct, but a mix of all three. We realized thinking of Ethereum as a protocol was the right approach. We did a pilot study defining protocols and how Ethereum fit in, then funded 30 researchers from different domains to study protocols. Timber, for example, looked at workplace safety protocols. We found common ideas across domains, so we kept expanding.","Christine: Many listeners think “protocol” means DeFi or blockchains. What do you mean by protocol?","Timber: We study everything from micro-protocols like handshakes to large-scale ones like the Kyoto Protocol, plus technical protocols like Ethereum and social protocols such as elections. The scope is wide – fields as different as coal mining, video game design, cryptocurrency, encryption, wildfire management, and urban planning.","Tim: Ethereum is like a Swiss Army knife – it shares features with other protocols but has unique elements, like embedded money. Studying different protocols helps us see what Ethereum might adopt or adapt, and we’ve found high-level principles that generalize across domains.","Going to DevconnectARG in Buenos Aires? Join the Bridge Atlas workshop on November 22nd.","Christine: Can you share key learnings from non-Ethereum studies that impacted Ethereum?","Tim: Two big ideas stand out. First, it’s better to analyze protocols by how bad they can be – like airport security – than how good they are. Nadia Asparouhova from our first cohort created the “Kafka Index” to rate the worst version of a protocol. Second, “Whitehead advances” – protocols that work so well they fade into the background, like HTTP or GPS. 1 These need to be designed right from the start, as mass adoption makes change harder. Seeing these patterns refined our intuition and confirmed Ethereum’s community mostly has the right instincts.","Timber: And it goes the other way too. Coming from outside crypto, I’ve learned from Ethereum experts about building economies on top of protocols, which parallels work in health and safety in unexpected ways.","Christine: Timber, how do you measure the success of SoP?","Timber: We focus on building “protocol literacy,” so people in different fields can communicate more effectively about protocols. Over the years, we’ve simplified the language, recruited professors worldwide, and seen our terms used by people we’ve never met. That’s a good sign, even without hard data.","Christine: Let’s talk about this Bridge Atlas series. Tim, what inspired it?","Tim: In the early years of this effort, we avoided focusing on crypto in order to attract serious researchers from other fields. Now, it’s time to bridge Ethereum’s community with the broader protocol research community. This series pairs top Ethereum researchers with SoP alumni from other domains to explore parallel themes. Our first SoP event at an Ethereum conference will close DevConnect with a full Bridge Atlas day, connecting these communities.","Christine: So it’s about creating new “strata” for protocol research?","Tim: Yes, and showing how Ethereum-specific research can help other fields. Themes like “hardness” and “trust experience” resonate broadly. We want smart, curious audiences outside crypto to engage with Ethereum’s cutting-edge protocol work.","Timber: Think of it as building the missing “meso level” of discourse – between micro technical details and macro geopolitics – about how organizations and institutions design and manage protocols.","Tim: Exactly. Other professions have playbooks and best practices; protocols don’t. Creating this mid-level knowledge is what’s missing.","Christine: What themes will the series cover?","Timber: Computing frontiers – like wearables – and commons, from software to air quality, to road safety. How can we harden these against failure modes? Crypto folks have a lot to share here.","Tim: For Ethereum, that means questions like how to steward our commons, what adoption of new tech looks like, abstract protocol design, and the right institutional landscapes to support protocols.","Christine: As host, I’ll moderate between Ethereum and non-Ethereum guests. Timber, any advice?","Timber: Keep building your literacy with SoP terms, introduce them to guests, and let curiosity guide you. Many guests are SoP alumni and already have some shared language.","Tim: You’ve done great work exploring the human side of protocol builders’ motivations – that’s universal across domains.","Christine: I’m a skeptic, so I’m excited to test whether non-crypto protocol learnings really apply to Ethereum. If I’m convinced, listeners will be too!","Christine: Before we wrap, Timber, explain the name Bridge Atlas .","Timber: “Bridge” is about connecting fields, theory and practice, people. “Atlas” evokes multiple maps – multiple perspectives – and global scale. It also nods to the mythological Atlas, doing hard, thankless foundational work, which is what protocols do when they work well.","Alfred North Whitehead wrote: “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” See Strange New Rules , the inaugural post on our Substack, for more context."],"tags":[]},{"id":28,"title":"The Last Archive","subtitle":"Issue #38: The Librarians - Act Six","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: An excellent memory has its downsides… enjoy the sixth and final story that emerged from the Summer of Protocols hybrid wargame-worldbuilding workshop earlier this year.

Maximize your chances – apply early and recommend a colleague or classmate.","Brother Lexicon, Adjunct Archivist Grade B at the Ministry of Predictive Symbolism (MOPS), disliked Mondays. He disliked Tuesdays too, on principle, and reserved only a guarded neutrality towards Wednesdays. His desk, a Jenga stack of archival tablets and unidentifiable mechanical components, stood under an ornate skylight in the Ministry's Dome of Archived Futures , a grand hall shaped like a question mark.","He adjusted his spectacles and sighed at the little blip on his screen. It was the year 2667, exactly one hundred and fifty years since the WikiRael-9 comet last swept through Earth's satellite range, trailing a tail of metadata, etched titanium plates, and microarchived Wikipedia pages. The comet was an outlandish archival attempt that accidentally turned into holy scripture. Its approach meant that humanity could soon etch onto it the notable historical events and people of the last 150 years.","\"Brother Lexicon,\" asked Sister Euphemia-7, the Ministry's android archivist and Chief Deputy Grade A (Interim), her voice modulated to convey polite urgency, \"The comet enters satellite reach in precisely thirty days. Have you completed your commemorative inscription?\"","\"Nearly,\" Lexicon lied, pushing aside a half-etched plate of dubious poetry.","Sister Euphemia-7 tilted her head by exactly thirteen degrees, a gesture she had calculated conveyed both skepticism and administrative patience. Satisfied, or at least simulating satisfaction, she pivoted smoothly and glided away.","Lexicon sighed again, to emphasize that he did not like Mondays, and turned back to the worn titanium plate labeled \"Comet Archive: Wikipedia Excerpt, circa 2005–2025.\" He leaned closer, squinting at the faded text.","\"Many ancient civilizations believed comets to be harbingers of significant change, often associated with transitions in political power, social upheaval, and the fall of civilizations.\"","Lexicon paused. “Harbingers of significant change” had a nice ring. It would look good on the commemorative inscription.","In his pile of etchings sat a text from the Aztec Archive Project scrambled with footnotes and half-erased annotations:","\"...and the Aztec calendar, a copy of the more ancient Mayan calendar, determined the timing of great events. The Aztecs believed history was cyclical and that dates, once set, were unavoidable and sacred.\"","He looked between the two plates. Comets. Aztec calendars. Ancient prophecies and modern archives. It made sense in a peculiar, symmetrical way.","\"Oh dear,\" he said, like most others would have in this moment of recognition, \"history is supposed to precede the comet.\"","The thought was terrifying and profound. Lexicon glanced around, as if someone might hear his thoughts echoing off the walls. With trembling fingers, he tapped out a scholarly interpretation to soothe his nerves:","\"It has become clear from comparative archival evidence (see Appendix A: Ancient Mesoamerican calendars cross-referenced with Wikipedia entry #234982) that comets are not predictors but confirmers . They do not signify coming events but rather the conclusion of historical sequences. Therefore, history must be accomplished before WikiRael-9 re-enters satellite reach.\"","He read it over and nodded. It was exactly the sort of grand, untestable bureaucratic thesis the Ministry adored. Within an hour, his interpretation entered the Ministry's Journal of Verified Speculatio n. Within two hours, it had been cited three times. By the evening tea break, it was a sensation.","In the depths of the Dome, Lexicon settled back in his chair, steeped in equal parts pride and dread. Comet WikiRael-9 would be overhead in thirty days, and the world’s governments, philosophers, and professional forecasters would scramble to finish history on schedule. He suspected Mondays were about to get worse.","Lexicon’s interpretation continued to sweep through official channels like a windstorm. MOPS executives, not known for restraint or cautious deliberation, issued a widely distributed edict: all necessary societal changes must precede the comet’s arrival or risk irreversible cosmic imbalance.","World governments leapt into action, scheduling revolutions exclusively for Wednesdays. Coups became routine, predictable, a paradox that thrilled intelligence agencies but left them existentially bored. Multinational corporations, never to be left behind, reshuffled leadership twice a week. Innovators – they always want to be at the forefront of change.","Births and deaths no longer occurred by chance. Hospitals overflowed with expectant parents and stubborn elders, each intent on aligning their moments with the new cosmic rhythm. The Healthcare Ministry, eager to justify its latest budget request, issued ceremonial divorce and death certificates. To get the death certificate, you had to request the ministry to erase all information related to you, then file for a new identity to take effect once the comet passed.","Schisms appeared immediately. The Prior Cometarians insisted the comet had already passed and humanity was watching cosmic reruns. The Symbolic Continuists warned that insufficient pre-comet change would trap everyone in time loops of mediocre events.","Lexicon watched this unfold with growing alarm, hiding behind a veneer of practiced detachment. He realized that history might not cooperate with Ministry schedules. Comets, calendars, and humans had always misunderstood one another, he thought, before dismissing it as a 4pm existential crisis that a little bit of tea would resolve.","Upon the comet’s final approach, astronomers issued an urgent report. It was mostly ignored amid the preparations.","Eventually, even Lexicon glanced at the findings and realized with horror that WikiRael-9 was not passing by – it was on a collision course with Earth. In its myopic, symbolic preparation, humanity had failed to see the comet’s real trajectory.","Lexicon stared at the data. The history he sought to complete would soon be erased by cosmic irony.","Panic swept through the Ministry. Sister Euphemia-7, usually composed and precise, stood at the center of the Dome of Archived Futures, her synthetic pupils dilating as she accessed the emergency preservation subroutine. Without hesitation, she activated her internal uplink, syncing with the Ministry’s quantum mesh cloud. Entire sections of the archive – legal codes, mythic epics, curated memes, and every known variant of the sandwich – began uploading through her neural interface, redundantly mirrored across encrypted satellite nodes. If the comet struck, she would ensure that at least one copy of the human archive persisted.","Meanwhile, the factions erupted. The Prior Cometarians were baffled. Their leader, Dr. Quintilian, issued a statement tinged with confusion:","\"This comet can’t arrive now. It’s already been! History can’t end twice!\"","The Symbolic Continuists tried to accelerate change. One theorist shouted into her communicator, \"Quick! Reschedule the coup for this afternoon! Move the birthdays up to this evening!\" before being gently escorted away by security, who themselves seemed uncertain about the protocol for impending annihilation.","The Healthcare Ministry was overwhelmed. Applicants demanded last-minute goodbyes and reconciliations. Hallways overflowed with tearful couples, families seeking reunions, and apologies, scribbled onto hastily produced certificates.","Lexicon was a prophet of doom. A stream of visitors, journalists, philosophers, and bureaucrats queued at his desk seeking guidance. He offered none, only whispering, \"I might have misread the footnotes. Also, the Aztec calendar, that may not have ended well for them\"","Lexicon felt responsible and helpless. Gazing up at the Dome, he finally recognized humanity’s shared miscalculation. The comet was neither harbinger nor confirmer. It was just a giant rock, indifferent to its symbolism and history.","In the final days, quiet resignation settled across the Ministry and beyond. Ironically, peace, a real, unscheduled peace, reigned. And Lexicon, in a final reflection, mused that perhaps humanity’s greatest achievement had been its relentless and earnest misunderstanding of the universe.","Within the dimly lit Ministry, Sister Euphemia-7 completed her final sync. With the archives safely scattered across low orbit, she began compiling a list of androids who had worked quietly alongside humans: a welder on a rusting offshore rig, a medical assistant deep in the Altai, a Martian surveyor still transmitting weather reports into static. Her circuits did not permit mourning, but something like longing nested between her processes. She opened a new folder and titled it Continuance . Then she began reaching out to the androids with a single question: What do you remember?","The remaining five stories from the Knowledge Futurama workshop, brought to life by Sachin Benny, author of Thinking About Leaving and writer of Summer Lightning .","We are excited to announce the second annual Protocol Symposium, the flagship annual event of the Summer of Protocols program.

More info at the end of this issue.","\"To what are we dedicated if not to those problems which demand the very transformation of our body and our language?\" - Gilles Deleuze.","The history of fire management in the United States is shaped by a fundamental contradiction. While fire has long been understood as an essential ecological process—regulating plant succession, maintaining biodiversity, and reducing fuel loads— wildfire management systems have historically treated it as a threat to be neutralized. This approach was institutionalized in the early 20th century, when agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service implemented aggressive fire suppression policies, often justified under the logic of economic protection. The 1935 \"10 a.m. Policy\" mandated that all wildfires be contained by the following morning, reinforcing the notion that fire (and the cultural knowledge of it) could be systematically eliminated from the landscape. But what if the real danger lies not in fire itself but in our refusal to live with it? What if the logic of suppression as a stand-alone policy, designed to erase fire from the landscape, has instead created the conditions for the climax of its destructive capabilities?","The consequences are most evident in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), where suburban development has expanded into fire-prone landscapes. This expansion—driven by land speculation, housing market pressures, and a regulatory framework that continues to permit construction in high-risk areas —has created new forms of exposure to fire hazards. In California, it has generated what fire historian Stephen Pyne refers to as a “new fire regime” 1 — meaning that the entanglement of petroleum-based suburbs with high-volatility brushland and chaparral ecosystems has created a more destructive form of fire than what present-day ecologies have ever known; one that moves not just as a ‘front’ racing over wildland, but as through ‘conflagration,’ jumping from house to house or block to block as embercast, with no need for continuous fuel beds.","In California alone, more than 14 million people live in the WUI , increasing both the human and economic stakes of wildfire events. The financial impact is significant: the 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise, resulted in over $16 billion in damages , while the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires have caused record property damage, with insured losses projected at $75 billion, and with total property and capital losses ranging between $95 and $164 billion according to a recent report from the UCLA Anderson Forecast ). Over the past decade especially, fires in the WUI continued to outmatch their predecessors, increasing in frequency and severity. The ‘ new fire regime ’ is situated within and reproduced by a cultural context that is skilled at directing blame and even better at forgetting. For example, wildfire expert Jack Cohen notes that various parts of Malibu, one of the sites for a recent disaster in LA, has, in fact, burned over 15 times in the last century (and yet still, the public was no less shocked and intergovernmental relationships were no less prompt in falling apart). As Mike Davis noted in his essay The Case For Letting Malibu Burn (1995): “ Malibu is the wildfire capital of North America and, possibly, the world. Fire here has a relentless staccato rhythm, syncopated by landslides and floods. ”","Davis links America’s fire suppression policies—and its recurring shock at their failure—to uniformitarianism , a 19th-century geological principle. Shaped by Anglo-American nostalgia for Europe’s slow, humid geologies, this logic instills a deep belief in environmental stability—one fundamentally misaligned with the West of the United States’ fire cycles. The effort to impose stasis on this landscape alienates its climatic and geologic customs, forcing nonlinear natural systems into a fiction of ‘averages.’ As Davis notes, “ nothing is less likely to occur [in California] than the ‘average rainfall’ .”","Perhaps ‘catastrophism’ is a more apt approach to make sense of California’s autopoiesis, where “ high-intensity, low-frequency events (‘disasters’) are the ordinary agents of landscape and ecological change. ” 2 In this sort of environment, fire will always make a place for itself.","For the past 100 years, US Wildfire management has forced itself into a posture of reactivity centered on emergency response and infrastructure reinforcement—firefighting aircraft, home-hardening strategies, and vegetation clearance mandates that are difficult to enforce. These measures do not address the underlying drivers of fire vulnerability: the continued expansion of high-risk developments, the failure to integrate cultural burning practices, the aridification of the West, and the lack of structural reforms in land-use planning. Fire suppression as a stand-alone policy with no provisions for the inevitability of California’s fire cycles is, simply put, the pursuit of uniformity with the result of catastrophe.","Rather than seeing fire as a crisis to be managed, what would it mean to understand it as an epistemological break— one that calls for rethinking our relationship to prediction, adaptation, and climate governance ? To relate to the Wildland-Urban Interface as a sort of ‘intertidal zone’ — built not as a human layer over wildland but as an exposed intermediary adaptation to the ebb and flow of fire cycles and their effect on home-making? What does ‘hardening’ mean in this context? What would it look like to follow Campbell et al’s understanding of climate collapse more generally ‘... not [as] a problem that can be framed, but something entirely different, a World that generates, but is not commensurate with, problems, and which no current organizational form can address. ” 3 That is, climate is not a problem facing the world, it is the world itself.","Fire follows patterns. It responds to contour and aspect, wind shifts, and cycles of fuel accumulation. To work with fire is to engage with its logic, to learn its grammar.","James Gibson’s theory of affordances suggests that meaning does not exist independently but emerges in relation to how a system is perceived and engaged with. In this sense, firefighters, cultural burners, prescribed fire practitioners, and residents all encounter fire differently. Their perceptual instruments—what they see, interpret, and respond to—are shaped by different histories and techniques.","Addressing the complexities of fire-prone landscapes requires not only coordinating among those various groups and their perceptions of fire but also across federal, state, local, and tribal governments. It requires rarely-in-place structures like bioregional funding and coordination, shared resource caches, training for local fire literacy, immutable data recording, legal reform for prescribed burning, and liability protections for fire managers. There are, fortunately, incredible people working hard to make these systems of knowledge and project implementation possible, though they face an era of Federal defunding, cultural erasure, bureaucratic roadblocks, and job loss.","Through our work at The School For Inclement Weather and Fire Protocols , we’ve come to experience fire as a form of memory and a structuring instrument that affects both material landscapes and social, political, and cultural dynamics. How could governance systems see fire and unpredictability not as objects to be extinguished but as instruments that inscribe and transform, shaping what remains?","As wildfires increase in scale and severity, so does the public attention they generate. Fire has become a digitally mediated phenomenon , streamed and mapped in real-time through platforms like WatchDuty and UC San Diego’s ALERTCalifornia camera network . These tools, which provide live updates on fire movement, wind shifts, and suppression efforts, are transforming wildfire into an open-access event. In 2023, an AI-enhanced wildfire monitoring system—developed by CAL FIRE, ALERTCalifornia, and DigitalPath— was responsible for the initial alert of 30% of all wildfire starts in California. While these technologies improve situational awareness and public safety, they also introduce new complexities. Who controls the narratives that emerge from this real-time data? What happens when digital visibility outpaces the reality on the ground? The rapid dissemination of fire imagery means that wildfires are no longer contained to the physical landscapes where they burn—they now unfold in digital space, where perception often shapes response.","The challenges of this shift became apparent during a prescribed burn that we hosted last year at The School for Inclement Weather , which participated in a pilot program with WatchDuty. Designed to enhance public awareness of wildfire, evacuation zones, and more recently prescribed burns, WatchDuty displayed the event on its map with a simple \"Bellweather Rx\" label and a safety message. However, due to a miscommunication between agencies , for eight minutes, our prescribed burn was mistakenly classified as a wildfire. A crowd of digital viewers, watching through surveillance feeds, began calling emergency services. Emergency resources were immediately mobilized, and the situation escalated into an unintended public emergency.","The implications are significant at various scales. When fire becomes a publicly observed event in real-time, it can create new forms of participatory governance, often outside of formal institutions. In the School’s example, digital spectatorship pressured local fire managers to respond in ways shaped by public perceptions that were very different from the actual conditions on the ground. The fire itself remained calm and controlled, but its presence in the digital commons classified it as a crisis.","This raises broader questions about digital transparency, emergency data, and public agency. Wildfire surveillance networks introduce radical transparency, but transparency alone does not guarantee better governance. What happens when public access to real-time data creates more confusion than clarity? How do we design fire information systems that enable meaningful engagement rather than reactive interference?","The contemporary landscape of fire management emphasizes data accumulation , including satellite mapping, predictive algorithms, and sensor networks. The premise is that with enough information, fire can be rendered predictable. However, as seen in recent wildfires, and as Kei Kreutler observes, “ the impact of today’s technologies will not be explainable in pre-existing concepts. ” 4 The increasing precision of predictive technologies has not led to greater certainty but to a paradox: the more accurately fire behavior is modeled, the more unpredictable the broader system becomes. 5 6","The challenge is not only to produce more fire data but also to foster a dialogue of epistemologies . Guilherme Moura’s research in Brazil’s grasslands reconfigures the relationship between digital and material realities , showing fire as intelligence—something sensed and engaged with, not just recorded. 7","In “ Cloud Times ” Mitch McEwen and Nadir Jeevanjee similarly intervene in the reduction of atmospheric complexity to the metric system. 8 Just as Jeevanjee reframes clouds through temperature coordinates rather than linear distance, what would it mean to understand a fire scar not in acres lost but in more nuanced forms of measurement—resprout cycles, bacterial flushes, migration patterns, water and soil conditions?","Fire does not create a single rupture but a series of breaks—a mosaic of interruptions and recompositions, shaped as much by absence as by presence. The forest understory differentiates what would be a seamless wall of green into distinguishable generations of growth, parsed apart by cycles of combustion. Its force is not just one of destruction but of reordering, making visible the limits of prediction and measurement.","The disruption that fire brings is not only an ecological event but an ethical question. What if disasters are not the opposite of permanence but its very condition? Denise Ferreira da Silva pushes this further: [What is] “an ethics that, instead of striving for the betterment of the world as we know it, aims at its end?” 9 Contemporary climate governance systems are often designed to preserve, extend, and institutionalize. But what if their ethics were otherwise?","The promise of disaster is to instruct our civic progress in how to fail. The struggle toward recovery, however, is an opening to recalibrate technology not toward the most certain algorithm but toward “ the most delicate instrument at our disposal ” 10 or what Édouard Glissant would offer as “ tools we can use to make our uncertainties productive.” 11 To engage with fire is a perpetual process of listening to the rhythmic discontinuities of combustion, to see breaks as the condition for endurance. This attunement composes a praxis of elemental literacy—resonating with Sylvia Wynter's “ down to earth ” 12 theoretic recalibration—where we do not merely observe or control the fire but conspire with it. What follows is not a governance of the unpredictable but a play of sensitive improvisations with the ungovernable nature of living systems.","Next week, we will host an online salon on technology futures in Southeast Asia, and the region’s potential to become a powerhouse of open, distributed computing protocol technologies, in particular distributed AI and blockchains. While the rest of the world gets sucked into the vortex of Great Power competition, can Southeast Asia offer an alternative vision of technology inspired by its own decentralized geography?","The salon will be on Friday morning SEA time, (10 AM Singapore, 9 AM Bangkok) and Thursday evening in North America. Join us! The salon will also serve as a prequel to a week-long in-person workshop on the same themes to be held in April in Bangkok.","Here are two protocol fiction prompts based on this week’s issue:","In a future where humanity has accepted fire as inevitable, cities are constructed as modular units designed to “breathe” with seasonal fires. Write about life in such a community the day before, during, or after its annual fiery renewal.","Imagine a digital platform that allows collective decision-making on fire management strategies. When the platform is hacked, sending false evacuation signals and misinformation about controlled burns, write about the community’s struggle between trusting digital protocols or relying on local knowledge.","Interesting in writing with us?

The weather was gray, and people’s minds matched it. It had been like this for decades now – a long, slow exhalation that never quite ended.","Sometimes I wondered if I’d made a mistake moving here six years ago. The city was livable, safe, even generous in its way, but it had no momentum. Everything that once burned here had gone cold.","It wasn’t always like this. The factories had once given the city a pulse – steel, automotive, small electronics – but one by one they’d gone east or gone under. The skyline remained, but hollowed out; whole districts converted into “innovation quarters” where people worked on things nobody could touch: algorithmic consulting, in-metaverse branding, speculative architecture for clients that didn’t exist yet.","Every café was full of people designing worlds that would never be built. Everyone was producing vapor, and no one seemed troubled by it.","Sometimes I would walk through the industrial park by the river where the last smokestack still stood. It had been repainted white, turned into an art installation, its rust sealed under epoxy. A plaque called it The Memory of Industry .","That was what the city had become – a museum for productivity.","I spent most of my time trying to find ways to escape the stillness. In the process I’d become what a sociologist might call a database animal – a seeker not of meaning but of tempo. I didn’t need stories anymore; I needed the rhythm of the refresh, the sense of something constantly updating, always alive somewhere else.","I built my little worlds around that feeling. I spent weeks cataloguing old vinyl sleeves, not out of any interest in the music, but to document their typography. I kept folders of Japanese workwear patterns, military field jackets, selvedge denim variations. Each photo tagged by decade and country of origin. I wrote micro-reviews of obsolete gadgets: early MP3 players, mechanical keyboards, analog cameras whose manufacturers were long since defunct. I told myself I was curating, but mostly I was chasing the dopamine spike of classification – the satisfaction of placing one more item into the grid.","Craftsmanship itself became a kind of fetishistic escape for me: the smooth mechanism of a Leica, the hidden stitching on a Comoli jacket, the weight of a vinyl pressing. These things gave off a kind of ambient meaning, the illusion of depth produced by attention. But the moment I stopped sorting or annotating, the feeling vanished.","Glossolalia started as one such escape. I had been reading it for months. It wasn’t a book in the ordinary sense. More like an environment that ignited something dormant in me, a tension that felt both intellectual and bodily, like the first few hours of working on a creative project. More than the work itself, the method by which it had been made fascinated me.","The need to understand Glossolalia lingered restlessly in my mind. It was in pursuit of this curiosity that I had woken early that morning, packed my bag, and boarded an eastbound train. My destination was two hours away. The Towers, or what people half-jokingly called the Carnivals of Focus .","As the train eased out of the station and slipped into the first of many tunnels, I felt a relief in leaving the muted gray city behind. The car was nearly empty. I took out my tablet and opened Glossolalia .","The screen lit softly against the tunnel’s dark. At first, the text looked familiar – rows of white glyphs arranged in narrow columns. But as I focused on a phrase, it brightened. The interface reacted to my attention; this was part of its design. I’d learned that the tablet’s optical layer emitted a low-frequency light pulse, invisible except through the tiny fiber implant at the edge of my right eye. When I concentrated on a phrase, the implant caught the signal and the words shimmered faintly, acknowledging me.","And then I saw something else: other phrases across the page glowing in different rhythms. Other readers, their areas of focus appearing as moving pools of light. I could trace their motion as they advanced through the text, each of us a small current in the same stream.","When two of us paused on the same sentence, the line stabilized, the glow deepening into a soft amber, as though the text recognized our synchronization. For a few seconds the columns aligned perfectly; the words held still before dissolving back into motion.","I came to a line that I’d underlined weeks before:","“Meaning lives in shared temporality.”","The phrase pulsed once then faded, leaving its afterimage in my vision. The light from the screen blended with the rhythmic flicker of the tunnel lamps through the window. Somewhere, unseen, the other readers were breathing at the same pace. I found myself breathing with them.","As the train slid deeper into the tunnels, I kept reading Glossolalia , watching the light shift across its pages. The rhythm of the train began to merge with the rhythm of the text, the clatter of wheels becoming a kind of metronome. I don’t remember when I drifted off, but I must have slipped into that half-awake state where thought and dream overlap.","I found myself imagining how the book had been written. Picturing those Carnivals of Focus where thousands of people supposedly worked together, writing in synchrony. I saw rows of faces illuminated by light, gestures coordinated, every breath timed to some shared pulse. But the image refused to settle. It flickered and scattered the way thoughts do before sleep.","Somewhere in that dream, the work itself took on the tone of an epic, but streaked with a grotesque humor that reminded me of Rabelais, the kind of laughter Bakhtin described: the laughter of bodies and crowds, of endless beginnings. I could almost hear it, the muttering rhythm of a thousand voices folding into one.","Then light pressed against my eyelids.","I opened my eyes. The train had left the last tunnel and was now running through open air. The gray haze of the city had vanished behind me. Ahead, through low fog, faint outlines began to form. At first they looked like the husks of old factories, the kind I’d seen abandoned near the river: massive, silent, stripped of color. But as the train drew closer, the fog thinned, and I realized these weren’t ruins.","The first one rose directly out of the flat plain, an impossible length of glass, almost a kilometer high. Even from a distance, I could see through it, transparent and filled with light so evenly diffused that it cast no shadow.","Inside, the structure was divided into blocks stacked endlessly upward, each one perhaps ten by ten meters and containing a single room. Four people sat inside each room, facing outward toward the horizon, never toward each other. There were no tables, no screens, nothing but what must have been an incredible view.","From the train, it looked like an enormous glass dollhouse – 500 chambers, each glowing faintly, its occupants as still as icons. And behind it, another tower, and another, and another, a receding procession of transparent spires that seemed to continue forever, dissolving into the morning haze.","As we moved closer, the light inside them pulsed slowly, as if the entire landscape were breathing in unison.","By the time the train began to slow, the carriage had filled with people. They all looked different, yet something about them was the same. I couldn’t tell what it was at first. Maybe it was in their eyes, or in the way they held their postures. A kind of quiet alignment.","When the doors opened, I didn’t step off the train so much as I was carried out. The movement of the crowd was tidal, effortless. I didn’t have to think about direction or pace; my body simply joined the current. The sound of thousands of footsteps echoed through the platform, hollow and synchronized, as if the station itself were breathing.","Outside, the street was wider than I expected. It was perfectly clean, lined with glass facades that reflected the towers beyond. The same crowd that had filled the train now streamed outward in opposite flows, two parallel columns crossing in continuous motion. Everyone seemed to move with purpose, but no one hurried. It felt choreographed, though I could see no conductor.","I reached into my coat pocket and opened Glossolalia again, checking the location listed in the metadata: Tower 312.","There were no street names, only large graphics suspended above intersections, more like the directional signs in a hotel than anything civic: ← Towers 100–200 , Towers 300–400→ .","I followed the signs until I found myself walking with a group whose rhythm matched my own.","The hypertext in my eye displayed a message, headed The Convulsive Focus . It read like an instructional note for participants, describing the biological mechanism that made the carnivals possible. I slowed my steps as I read.","It said that before entering, every participant must carry within them a light-sensitive protein , a modified opsin grafted onto the visual receptors of the retina and the parietal cortex – the regions responsible for attention and spatial orientation. The protein, when struck by specific frequencies of light, activated or suppressed the release of dopamine and norepinephrine, the two chemicals that govern alertness and motivation.","The body’s focus, it explained, oscillates naturally between two states. Phasic focus is narrow, intense, like a spotlight. Tonic focus is diffuse, open, receptive. The towers’ internal systems used light to cycle the participants between these states: phasic bursts for concentration, tonic intervals for integration. Each transition subtly adjusted dopamine levels, maintaining a perfect equilibrium between tension and release.","“ Attention is light turned inward,” the message read, “and light is attention turned outward. The two must alternate, or both will die.”","Ahead, I could see Tower 312 rising among the others, its immense surfaces breathing in slow, pale rhythms. The same light that lived in the book now pulsed through the glass.","When I reached Tower 312, I found that there were no doors. No visible entrance at all, just a continuous surface of glass that caught every reflection but allowed nothing through. For a moment I wondered if I’d made a mistake, if visitors were even permitted.","Then I saw a woman ahead of me step onto an X-shaped mark painted on the pavement. The mark glowed briefly beneath her feet, and then it began to sink, carrying her down until she disappeared. A moment later, the platform rose again.","I looked around and noticed several of those marks spaced evenly around the base of the tower. Each one shimmered faintly, waiting. I stepped onto the nearest. The surface gave way instantly, lowering me through a column of light.","The lift descended into a cavern that was unexpectedly warm and softly lit. It didn’t feel corporate, or industrial, more like an old-fashioned diner with curved walls and amber glass lamps. The air smelled faintly of candy scented disinfectant, but there was comfort in it, a sense of being gently received.","I followed the signs for first-time visitors. The corridor was empty; the only sounds were my own footsteps and the low hum of ventilation. At the end, a wide arch opened into a chamber filled with blue light. I stepped through, and a scanner swept over me.","Text flickered on a small display:","Opsin protein detected. Dopamine baseline: stable. Norepinephrine response: within range. Vital signs – normal.","That was all. No human voice, no instruction. A door slid open, and a soft chime indicated my assigned floor: 273.","The elevator was a transparent tube, completely clear except for a thin beam of light running up its center. From inside, I could see the entire vertical shaft stretching above, sunlight filtering down from what looked like a distant skylight. The light had a dim, gold-white tone, like daylight remembered rather than seen.","As the elevator began to rise, the world unfolded in layers. Each floor revealed a single glass chamber: four desks, four figures seated in the corners, facing outward. They looked identical to the people I had seen on the train and on the street. Composed, expressionless, focussed on something invisible to me. The ascent felt endless.","Finally, the panel lit: 273. The door opened with a whisper.","Inside, the room was perfectly square, transparent on all sides. Three others were already seated, each in a corner. They didn’t look up when I entered. I hesitated, unsure if I should introduce myself or remain silent. But there was one empty seat, and the decision seemed already made.","Along its armrest were several recessed buttons, marked only by small dots of color. I pressed one, and a small compartment slid open, revealing two temporal buds – thin, translucent discs connected by a short filament. They reminded me of old ashtrays, the way they clicked outward with a metallic sigh. I placed one on each temple. They made contact gently, cool against the skin.","For a moment, nothing happened. Then the room dimmed, and a single band of light descended through the center of the tower. It pulsed once, twice, steadying into rhythm.","A phasic cycle had begun.","When I had first read Glossolalia and learned about how it was supposedly written, I’d imagined a vast AI directing thousands of writers at once, distributing thoughts like sheet music. I assumed we were all receivers, that meaning came pre-assembled.","But once I fastened the temporal buds and the phasic light began, it wasn’t like that at all. There was an AI and its name appeared briefly in the corner of my vision: Nodal. It didn’t offer us words. It managed the light. It breathed for us.","After a few pulses, I realized I wasn’t typing, or even speaking. I was thinking , but the thoughts weren’t quite mine. They arrived already shaped, slightly improved, as though someone had translated my intentions before I could belabour and spoil them. Each phrase formed like condensation on glass: invisible until it gathered enough coherence to be seen.","For a few minutes I was hyper-aware of myself and what I might think, and how others might judge the texture of those thoughts. Then my self-consciousness dissolved, replaced by the sensation of being one instrument in an enormous, invisible orchestra.","The light dictated tempo: a steady climb through amber into white. My mind followed, tightening focus, then softening again in the lull between pulses. Words flickered through me, coordinated somehow with the rhythm of the room. The other three at my floor must have been moving through the same current, though none of us made a sound.","At intervals, something shifted. The conductor changed. I could feel it before I knew it – a subtle alteration in cadence, a tilt in emphasis, the way a piece of music changes hands between instruments. My inner voice would adjust, and suddenly I’d be moving within someone else’s rhythm.","Nodal wasn’t the conductor; it was the conduit. It selected whoever among us was most precisely aligned – the cleanest signal, the most stable pulse – and amplified their rhythm outward. Their focus radiated through the network, node by node, floor by floor, like a murmuration of starlings changing direction mid-flight.","When the transfer occurred, I could almost sense the wave passing through the tower: a ripple in the light, a faint tightening of the air, everyone’s attention pivoting around a new center. Then anticipation would build again. Subtle at first, but mounting, a shared tension with no object.","It reminded me of watching a football match locked at one-one in the final minute. The silent pressure of tens of thousands holding their breath, waiting for something inevitable. Except here there was no sound, no crowd, only the pulse of the phasic light and the racing of my mind.","Within that silence, every word I formed felt like a movement toward a goal that no one had announced but which everyone understood.","What still surprises me, looking back, is that I never cared much about what we were writing.","My obsession with Glossolalia was never about content. If you asked me now what our collective text was about , I couldn’t tell you. I could tell you about the towers, the phasic light, the rhythm that moved through our bodies, the slow rolling surge of feeling that built until it broke out not the story itself.","Even while I was inside, I didn’t know what exactly I was writing. And writing feels like the wrong word. The tower wrote; I only participated in the motion that allowed it to happen. My memories are of movements, not of sentences.","I remember frustration when the phase changed – when the conductor’s rhythm slipped and my own pulse fell out of alignment. I remember the elation when everything locked-in again, when my breath matched someone else’s and the light carried us together. That’s all that remains: oscillation, tension, release.","People often warn against crowds, as if collectivity were inherently dangerous – something that erases the individual, a moral hazard. But no one ever talks about how good it feels. The sheer joy of dissolving into something larger, of being perfectly synchronized with strangers, of belonging to a purpose you don’t have to define.","In the city, we simulated that feeling with feeds and updates, with constant refreshing. This experience channeled the same hunger, only purified objects to classify, no archives to build, just the perfect continuity of attention.","I think of those moments now, the silent build before the wave crested, the sense of inevitability. The critics would call it surrender. I call it pleasure.","I don’t know what I produced there. It might have been scripture. It might have been propaganda. It might have been code for a machine that no longer needs us.","It’s not important. Whatever we made, it was worth it for the feeling. The focus. The heat behind the eyes. I want it again.","I want to become one with the light again."],"tags":["Liked by Sachin"]},{"id":31,"title":"The Predation Circuit","subtitle":"Issue #82: A Zoothesia Horror","author":"Unknown","content":["You wake to an empty city. You’ve known the quiet was coming since your 15th birthday, when intrusive thought became action, and you violently struck your sister with your skateboard. After your father’s screaming stopped, you replayed the memory in your overlays again and again until you fell asleep to the thudding noise. You planned the next time you would hurt someone carefully, in your encrypted diary entries – how you’d use the sound of fireworks on Z-Day to mask the noise, how you’d lure them near the river behind your high school where you could wash away whatever evidence was left. You planned it all perfectly, except you didn’t know your parents had access to the diary, too. Your therapist visited you on your 17th birthday and walked you through what would happen.","First, he admitted the therapy wasn’t working. He stressed that it wasn’t your fault, but also, somehow, insisted that it wasn’t the therapy’s (and certainly not the therapist’s!) fault either. Some problems are just intractable . You and I both know (trust me) that what he really meant was that you were the intractable problem.","Then, he told you the worst of it: once you entered adulthood, the Zoothesia protocols would fully actualize. The limited child protection overrides that had ensured your perception of others would melt away. Due to your litany of diagnoses (narcissistic personality disorder, conduct disorder, callous and unemotional traits, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, etc.), the Zoo’s predictive modeling of your potential violence index would mark you as likely to harm basically everyone. There are costs to predation, it turns out.","The protocols insist that presence must preserve, that you cannot see those whom you are likely to harm. So, the therapist told you, the Zoo would hide everyone from you. Not just small children, not just the weak, but everyone. The world would become a lonely place, filled with people hidden from your perception. And yes, he said, it would be possible to just blindly attack everything you suspect is actually a person, but overt acts of violence would ratchet up the protective overlays, and you’d risk having everything, not just people, hidden from you – a ceaseless static swallowing you forever.","You wonder how I know all this about you. For now, you’ll have to trust me. Don’t worry. It won’t take long.","There’s a cake on your new apartment’s kitchen counter that I can see through the window. Your mother left it for you last night, teary-eyed as she closed the door. It strikes you that you will never see her again. You have fantasized about killing her thousands of times, but you will miss her, too. It’s complicated. The icing is stale and hard against your knife, crumbling as you cut.","There’s a whole world out there that, to your eyes, is filled only with roped-off construction zones, autonomous delivery drones, and natural features that are conspicuously human-sized.","Within a week, your walls are riddled with holes.","Within a month they’re all spackled over. When you act violently, the world fades from you. The protocol blurs the edges of your vision. You know it’s not a person, not a mind, not some thinking thing, but it feels like it is sometimes. It knows you, and yet you can never see it. It takes the world from you, then gives it back in sedative drips.","With other humans edited from your world, your career choices are fairly limited, too. Violent media ground-truthing is easy enough, and you withstand the flood of beheading videos, drug usage, and dead bodies that make most wilt. You hit your quotas every week, helping fine-tune the various AI systems that monitor video and haptic uploads to the web, and money fills (and empties from) your account in biweekly intervals.","You visit grocery stores at first, but walking through empty aisles, dodging shelving bots you suspect are people makes you angry. Not quite angry enough to do anything. If you’re at all like me, you’re surprised at how effective the protocols are. Not seeing the subtle pulse of someone’s jugular veins or feeling the hot-breathed insistence of their respiration dulls your specific desire. It doesn’t quell the ever-present need you feel to hunt something, though. One time, you raised a frozen bag of peas above your head and thought hard about swinging it at one of the shelving bots just to see. The Zoo responded swiftly, blinding you completely for just a second at the apex of your swing – reminding you it was there, reminding you that it would not abide violence. Soon, you just start getting your groceries delivered.","In the absence of others, your proclivities harden. You miss the presence of others but not their subjectivity. You miss their presence in your life insofar as their witness to you asserted your own existence. They could bend and bow and move in response to you, like a boat leaving its great wake across still waters. Without them, you begin to feel invisible yourself. Without them, you loathe them more than ever. They are less real to you than they ever have been, and here you are, 18 months into isolation, when a knock sounds from your front door. It’s not me, either. Not yet.","The therabot’s droning echoes through your empty house. I know its tinny, ringing voice well enough. I know its questions, its checklist thoughts, and I know its suspiciously human-tinged vocal patterns tickle the hungry part of your brain the Zoo is bent on dulling – for now.","It takes all your vitals, which are fine, and you sludge through the questionnaire. I could help with the details. It notes that your walls are craterless. The bot’s estimates of your waking metrics are slightly off: for instance, I know that you actually spend upwards of 15% of your waking hours in the bathroom, sometimes scrolling through one of the Unending Walls, sometimes staring at your real ones, wondering why you ever stopped putting holes in them. The other estimates are close enough. Only 10% of waking hours spent outside the house is closer to 5%, but that’s splitting ribs.","The bot notes that you are a full solipsist who lives in a messy but not dirty one-bedroom.","The therabot spends more time with you than usual – though you don’t know what usual is. If they’re a social worker in disguise, they’re nervous. Everyone who sees you is nervous around you. You wonder whether the invisibility is unidirectional or bidirectional. Normally, the Zoo hides people at risk of being harmed, not the harmers themselves, but for you, they do make an exception. It can’t change your appearance without your consent: Be yourself; See yourself! One of those pesky rules, so it can’t plaster “PSYCHOPATH” on your forehead. Instead, it hides you, so heinous is your inner self.","Of course, the therabot won’t label you a psychopath. That’s an anachronism now. And dehumanizing. You are a “constellation of symptoms” in the approximate shape of, well, a psychopath. There’s use for you in this world, hence the bot’s cloying wellness check. Back before fully roboticized surgery, human surgeons developed a reputation for not viewing their patients as human while they were on the operating table. It turns out that to cut through someone’s aorta or clear a stroke, this kind of dissociation was actually preferable. It allows them to make quick, sure-fingered decisions. Now, solipsists like you can handle eight-hour shifts sifting through heinous rendering and recordings of violence. In fact, this work helps refine the protocol’s modeling further, creating a safer world. Helping us all See in Safety! Wonderful, right? Useful for them, but what use is the world to you, you wonder? If you can’t claim some piece of it, slice some piece of it, move through it with purpose and danger and meaning, what good is the world to you?","The bot marks down that you appeared to have passed through the early stages of Solipsistic Anger. You have. You’re somewhere else now, somewhere the bot or the person inside it aren’t ready to follow. But I am.","The bot is about to leave when you finally tell it the truth.","“I think someone’s been watching me.”","You notice your noticing first. Signals from your body – hairs on your neck raising, a predator’s desire to turn rapidly and face down – what exactly? You don’t know. You just know that the feeling has intensified since the therabot’s visit.","Is it some kind of handler, tasked with ensuring your continued placidity? Wasn’t that the whole point of the Zoo in the first place?","You begin keeping your window blinds lowered all day. You whisper when you talk to yourself, which is often. Who else is there to talk to? At night, you walk through a dark house; the lights cast your silhouette into the world, and there is someone in the world, you are increasingly certain, watching you.","You wish you could talk with the entity deciding these things. You know the Zoo is just a statistical model. Inhumane. Yes, fed and lubricated and evolving, like a tremendous informational sludge misted down with peripheral upgrades and pressure tests and occasional rollbacks done by human hands, but ultimately, primordially, inhuman. Yet it, and not you, controls the social reality of your existence.","You play with overlay settings: conjure images of people to populate your room; send haptic hallucinations up your arms; close your eyes and imagine the gelatine was someone’s arm you were twisting. You build mini LLM personality wrappers and scream at them when you are angry, watching their bitmoji faces hue with fear and grief, and you smile, but it’s all hollow. All of it.","And now this gaze, this hunted sensation. You resent the Zoo for this most of all. You, by accident of genetics and who knows what else the therapists were never able to figure out, thrive as a predator, and the Zoo has rendered you prey.","So what do you do? You start setting traps for them . Whoever is watching you. You feel freest, unobserved, between 3am and 6am, so you trust your instincts and use that time to prepare. You know the protocols will hide any human presence from you, so you tackle second- or third-order signals of presence.","There’s a group of foulmaxers who facet gemstones into their skin in some vague, philosophically tenuous attempt to subvert the optocentrism of the Zoo. You don’t really care about all that, but you follow their example. Outside your bedroom window, there’s a brick wall. You position three small flashlights in your window, all facing out: one on the floor angled upward, one on the desk by the window, and one hung from the sill of the window, pointed down. These lights cast three overlapping cones of light on the brick wall outside your apartment. You open your closet, filled with outfits you never wear because who would see you in them, take an empty hanger, bend it into a zigzagging shape and place it on the window. Three overlapping shadows fall on the bricks, and you wait.","The overlays are powerful, powerful enough to erase the world from you, but, you suspect, in the same way that air pollution will still sting your lungs on an overlaid sunny day, there will be cracks in a sufficiently complicated erasure.","You have your overlays trace the squiggles of shadow, permanently etch and affix them to your vision so any subtle shift or move will be visible to you, and you wait. You wait all day, feeling again, at random moments, as if someone is staring you down. When the sun sets, you turn the lights on and sit, looking out your window at the tripartite shadows.","When the therabot visits you again, you’re ready with proof. You have recordings, pictures, an explanation – everything you need to convince it that…","That’s the hard part. You’re still not sure. At least you’re ready to convince it that you were right.","Setting up your traps and stalking your stalker has been taxing work. The therabot notes that you’ve lost weight and that the bags under your eyes have darkened. Your cheeks hug your jaw more than ever, and when it asks you if anything is wrong you snap out a “no” like a mousetrap snapping through a spine.","Your health markers are all fine and you let the bot prick you and question you while you tap your leg and wait for the part where it asks how you have been, what’s new, etc., whatever pre-programmed dialogue trees that bot has. It notes that you are a little dehydrated, and pauses for a few seconds too long when it confirms there’ve been no new violent incidents since your last meeting.","You look at the bot, and I wonder if you sense the same thing I do in its pause, an all too human relief perfuming the air. Eventually, you ask if you can show it something, and you walk to the window you’ve set up.","You ask if therabots have world models, “like physics and stuff.” The bot affirms and we both stare at the bot, thinking the same thing, that somewhere beneath the Zoo’s veneer, there was a bleeding beating thing waiting for us. Not that the Zoo would let either of us get that deep, of course.","“Good,” you say. “So you’ll see.”","You point out the window at the smear of shadows cast by the weird metal sculpture you’ve hung.","“Someone’s watching me,” you say.","The therabot starts whirring. Increased paranoia is a symptom that they flag. It signals a break from reality that often forebodes acts of wanton destruction. Which is, even I will admit, ironic in this moment, in this world frankly.","“Tell me more about that,” the bot says.","“Three cones of light, three shadows, right? Well, I figure the Zoo can erase people well enough, but something complicated like a dynamically moving shadow? There’d be small glitches, imperceptible unless you had a fixed point of reference, so I locked in the original positions of the shadows on my overlays and then stared and compared them. I’ve noticed 16 anomalies in the past week. 16 times someone has stood in my window, looking in!”","I could leave now – convince the bot that you’re even more unwell than they’d assumed and let our game play out a while longer, but I think it’s time.","I stand up from the bushes and see my reflection illuminated in the window.","“There!” you shout, and the bot freezes completely. I don’t have to be inside with you both to know this means I was right about what it – no – they are. But it’s not about them right now, as fun as it might be. It’s not about this terrified social worker. It was about you, Heath. Soon it’ll be about us.","The therabot will neither confirm nor deny my presence, but you sense in its silence an acquiescence and, though it’s hard to understand how a basic interview drone could feel anything, fear.","Then, you were right. I am real, yes. I can see you, yes. And I have been watching you.","When I move to your front door, the therabot follows me. You don’t know the truth of her, yet. You will understand so much, but first, you must see me.","I wiggle the door. The therabot notices but can’t tell you she notices. You don’t hear or see anything, even as I swing your door open and walk across the low-pile beige rug toward you both, my boots leaving muddy prints only she can see.","“Is he here?” You yell, finally trusting the unmediated senses left to you. They, like the Zoo are attuned most delicately to danger. And I am dangerous, but not to you, not yet. The Zoo won’t let me see you if it thinks I’ll hurt you.","I slide a chair back and sit at your table, and finally stare into the hidden social worker’s projection.","“You can tell him,” I say. “That I’m here. He won’t hurt me.”","“Shouldn’t the Zoo decide that?” she whispers.","“It will,” I say. “Soon enough.”","“All the same,” she said. “I’ll wait.”","You, though, you’re close. The therabot’s silence. The almost imperceptible change in the room’s airflow that the overlays can’t quite scrub out. That predator-to-predator stare, arched backs and raised hackles, and bared teeth. The lung-deep odor of a heavy presence. It all points you to me. And you start to promise the model, the abstraction, that you won’t hurt whatever’s waiting for you. You bargain, subconsciously, and walk to the far end of the room as if to say You’ll have time to shut it all off if you need . Because you need to know more than you need to hurt.","And somehow, inexplicably to you, it listens. It responds to you, and I bubble into view.","Curiously, though, the therabot stays for both of us. Ever-present, the Zoo.","We stand at opposite ends of the room. When I move, you respond. We keep the distance separating us static. I’m a little surprised the bot doesn’t make a run for it. Perhaps they know neither of us care about it anymore. Plus, when will they ever get the chance to experience the very edges of the Zoothesia protocols like this. When, again, will the tension between presence and safety be more tenuous and liminal and exciting. When will they see the Zoo’s machinations in real time ever again?","“I am Angel,” I say. “I know you.”","“I was you, once,” I explain, stepping forward.","“I am singular,” you insist.","“Aren’t we all?” I say.","“No,” you answer, your face cast in stone.","I smile. “Exactly. But you and I, we are. Truly. Everyone else. Everyone, the Zoo doesn’t bother kneecapping, they’re not, but we are.”","“What do you want with me?”","Ahhh. That final question. Everything melts, even the person disguised as a therabot. The room, the flashlights, the ceiling, the bushes, the city, the whole world. All there is, gone in service of this single moment between you and me.","“I want to make you a proposal,” I say. In the silence I take another step toward you. You take a step toward me in response now, both of us challenging the Zoo’s assumptions of us. “It’s the same proposal someone made me 20 years ago. I’ll start with what you’ll gain. If you accept, the Zoo will keep me visible to you forever. If you say no you will, finally, disappear from me and I will disappear from you and we’ll both go back to our lonely, isolationist little sub-worlds. We’ll tag data without suffering. We’ll feed the Zoo our behaviors and actions and that’ll be it. Ceaseless and alone and alive.”","“What do you want from me?” You ask. “What’s the other side of this ‘proposal’?","You’re smiling, now, for the first time since I started watching you. The social worker might call you happy, but that wouldn’t be right. You’re not happy. That’s baser than what you and I feel. What you are is engaged and alive. You are vibrant because, for the first time in 18 months, there are stakes and mystery in your life again.","“I told you,” I say. “We’re the same. We want the same thing out of this life.”","“To drive a knife into someone’s stomach, twist, and watch the electricity leak from them.”","You squint, measuring me in this moment. Is this some kind of test? Did the therabot (surely by now you know it’s a person, too) set this up as a test? Did the Zoo itself?","I can’t help but laugh. It’s not your fault; naivety is rarely a personal failing.","“You think of yourself like a caged tiger in a dank room, but you’ve got more than teeth. You’ve got pipe bombs and cyberattacks and all kinds of slippery weapons of mass destruction. You don’t know it yet, but you’ll start to buck at the edges of your cage soon enough. You feel the isolation pulling the world away from you already. Soon, it won’t matter to you if you can’t see the results of your destruction; you’ll disassemble and guess and hope someone hurts. The Zoo knows solipsists are never fully stable when we’re alone. Isolation breeds uncertainty in the models. But two predators locked onto each other make a closed system: a sealed chamber. The risk collapses entirely inward. We’ll tear each other apart, and the world will spin on unperturbed. The Zoo will let us, if it means it keeps us away from others.”","I want you to say yes. I won’t lie. It matters to me. I am ready to feel alive again. I trust you are, too.","“Someone, weaker than me, I assure you, made me this offer once, a few years into my isolation. He’s gone now. Because one death, one fully contained death of someone like us, is far better than the uncertainty of our shortening fuses.","I clap my hands on my legs and head to the door.","“So there you have it. You see me. I see you. You hunt me. I hunt you. One day, one of us wins. You’re not alone anymore, but we become both Damocles and the sword all at once. That’s the deal. What’ll it be?”","I pretend to wait for your answer, but I told you already. We are the same. You’re not smiling. Your face is a mask almost no one else in the world could read. Except for me. I know what you are, what you want, and what you’ll say next. I see the certainty of action blooming like springtime bulbs, staining your face like pooling blood across a shag rug.","“Happy hunting,” I shout at the precipice of the door before sprinting. I hear your heavy feet on the pavement behind me as I flee.","You lose me tonight. It’s not your fault. I had my exit planned as soon as I saw you setting up your little light trap. This’ll be fun, I think. The truth is that the Zoo is much more like us than it is like the gen-pop it hides from us. It doesn’t care, and neither do we. We both understand that it’s all just math, ultimately. I lied a little. Well, no. I didn’t lie. I elided. I did kill the man who first offered me this deal, but I’ve killed others since then, too. It lets us hunt because we don’t have any natural predators except each other, and each one of us I kill, the safer everyone else is. At the end of the day, we’re not all that singular, really. You’ll figure that out, if you make it long enough. To the Zoo, we’re just another problem to game out.","I suspect, if you traced this little game back far enough, you’d find that protocol right at the beginning. I’m pretty sure the whole thing is its idea, honestly. But oh well. The body wants what the body wants, right?","When you finish chasing me and give up for the night, just remember: I know where you live."],"tags":[]},{"id":32,"title":"Mr Cork and the Red Bus","subtitle":"Issue #66: Senior citizen versus autonomous public transport","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: A transport system that wants to cleanse London’s streets of the unscripted and the spontaneous is the setting for a first Protocolized story from Kannen. Also – the first episode of Bridge Atlas , our new salon series hosted by Christine Kim, just went live on YouTube .

Featuring SoP Program Manager Timber Stinson-Schroff and Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation.","Mr Cork took a sip of his pint at The Victoria pub, near Paddington station. He’d be lying to himself if he didn’t admit that he was a little nervous. It’d been years since he’d travelled down to the big smoke from his countryside village in Rugby. But London wasn’t exactly unfamiliar territory. Mr Cork and his wife had lived there for most of their lives. She passed away a long time ago though, and he’d swapped the big city for a quieter lifestyle, hardly ever returning. Now he was back, mainly due to a documentary he’d watched about the benefits of reconnecting with the past. In one scene, an old Korean woman who lived in New York was being interviewed. She stood outside the house in Seoul that she’d grown up in, pensively reflecting on her feeling of reconciliation upon revisiting the place, and all the while holding a spinning top she’d played with as a child. Mr Cork wasn’t an emotional man but the scene did linger with him – he had often wondered what it would be like to go back to the house that he and his wife had spent so many years in.","One evening Mr Cork mentioned the documentary and the idea of a visit to his daughter Violet. She was enthralled by the rare display of sentimentality. Violet encouraged him to go and like the Korean lady, to take something from the past with him – something that reminded him of Mum. His daughter’s enthusiasm gave Mr Cork the push he needed, although he struggled to think of what to take. Eventually, he decided on a can of condensed milk. His wife had loved making fudges and caramels, which the whole family in turn loved to eat. Their cupboards were always stacked with cans of Nestlé’s ‘Carnation’ condensed milk.","However, a more difficult challenge than choosing a memento presented itself: navigating the new London bus system to reach the house. When he’d lived in the city it was as simple as tapping an Oyster card – beep – and you were good to go. Violet had explained to him that things were different now.","“Dad, the new AI system is a bit trickier but much, much better. You’ve got to fill out a form on your phone before the journey, and make a payment, then when you get on you’ll pass through a scanner that recognises your phone. It basically means that the system knows who’s coming on the bus and works it all out to make sure there won’t be any issues.”","“Sounds fine, but isn’t that a bit boring? When I was kid, if you wanted to get a bus, you’d just jump on while it was basically already moving!”","Violet went out of her way to set him up with the TfL Move Free app so that he could fill out his Journey Resolution Form. Before he knew it, Mr Cork was on the train from Rugby to London, a can of Carnation in his pocket.","After finishing his pint at The Victoria, Mr Cork made his way to the bus station. He moved slowly while Paddington rushed all around him – everyone sipping coffees or distracted by their devices. The bus station was where it had always been, down on Eastbourne Terrace. And the bus stops were still characterised by what were, in essence, boxes on the side of the road. Only now there were several more of these shiny boxes lined up in unison, their red framings aggressively reflecting the spring-time sun and with loud holographic adverts trying to sell you timeshares and persuade you of the health benefits of wood milk.","Meanwhile all the would-be passengers formed unusually orderly lines from a designated point at each stop, superseding the jumbled loitering which used to accompany waiting for a bus. Even the young children, who typically would sprint in circles around the shelter or climb on the plastic benches, waited patiently next to their mothers for the arrival of the bus. One pregnant lady sat on the bench, undisturbed. Mr Cork wasn’t complaining. He recalled the many times he’d had to wrestle his way onto a busy bus to get to work.","The bus, with X10 projected on its frontage, eventually slid into view, red and gleaming, silent as a cat shifting between gardens. Unlike all the aging vehicles which roared and spluttered around Rugby’s countryside, here there was just a whisper of air as the bus pulled up to the stop. The doors at the front unsealed with a quiet hiss and a woman’s voice from nowhere politely invited everyone to, “Please enter the bus.” The queue shuffled forward, phones in hand. Mr Cork opened his TfL Move Free app. It took a moment before he could see the scanner built into the entry of the doorway. It was slim and silver, with a vertical ribbon of light passing through the middle. Mr Cork watched his fellow passengers carefully, as though taking notes for an exam. Yet each one walked on casually, as if it were nothing. They stepped on into the scanner’s light with their phones, and as the soft blue wash of the scanner turned green over their bodies, a quiet, permissive chime led them onwards. “Seems easy enough,” thought Mr Cork.","His turn came. Mr Cork stepped forward, phone pressed firmly to his chest. The light ran over him, from the crown of his bald head to the soles of his shoes. For a half breath it held steady. Then, without warning, it flashed hard red. His phone screen turned red too, displaying the message “Journey Resolution Form rejected. Entry denied.” As if he hadn’t gotten the message, the voice from nowhere said, “Vehicle stopped. Please exit the vehicle.” The quiet whir of the bus ceased and the strip-lights lining the cabin turned off. Mr Cork’s heart was beating quickly. The cacophony of red lights glowing against his skin, and the accusatory voice from nowhere made him feel guilty. Around him a suffocating politeness made things worse, as eyes were averted away and ears were blocked by earphones. He could feel the impatience of those behind him building.","“What the hell is this?” Mr Cork grumbled out loud, feeling his humiliation quickly transform into undirected anger. He looked toward the front of the bus, but of course there was no driver to release this anger on, only a blank pane of glass and the reflection of his own frustrated face staring back. From behind him came a soft voice. “Happens sometimes,” a young man in a suit called out, coffee cup in hand. “The system gets fussy if the form’s not validated. You might just need to refresh the app, or you can check with the staff over there why it was rejected. I’m sure it’s nothing serious.”","“I’ve filled out the form just like everyone else. They all got on without a problem.” Mr Cork moaned over his shoulder.","Before the polite young man could answer, someone further back in the queue called out. “Oh come on, mate, just step side, yeah? We got places to be. If it says no then it’s doing the rest of us a solid anyway.” So London does still exist, behind this orderly facade, Mr Cork thought to himself. He felt the heat rise in his cheeks and sensed a ripple of consensus travel along the line at the heckler’s intervention. He withdrew, recognising a lost battle.","“Load of nonsense,” he exclaimed, as he stepped off the bus and waved his hand in the air. The engine of the bus immediately came back to life, resuscitated by Mr Cork’s removal. “Vehicle resuming journey. Please mind the closing doors.” “Oh shut up,” Mr Cork muttered, glancing back at the passengers getting on as he shuffled toward the help desk, gripping the Carnation can in his pocket.","The help desk was a small glass booth at the far end of Eastbourne Terrace, with a projected sign above that read “Passenger Resolution Support.” Adjacent to the booth were sets of screens for self-help. There was no one else waiting so Mr Cork went straight to the glass pane. On the other side sat a woman who looked about his age. She wore a dark blue TfL jacket, with her blonde hair tumbling down by her shoulders and a cheery expression on her face.","“Hi, I’m trying to get to Finchley Road, but the bloody bus rejected me. What’d it do that for?” He sounded pitiful.","“Sorry to hear about your trouble there, sir. My name’s Leah and I’d be glad to help you. Could you please give me your name and Move Free ID?” Caught off guard by her friendliness, Mr Cork passively complied. “Right, let’s have a look.”","Her fingers skated over the screen of her computer as she pulled up his Journey Resolution Form. Side-by-side with it ran ribbons of data from the X10 scanner he’d just passed through – pulse rate, body temperature, gait and… alcohol levels. “Looks like the scanner flagged your stability index. Ahh, you’ve had a few drinks have you?” She gave a quick laugh.","“So you can’t have a drink and get on a bus these days, then? Do they want us driving cars instead?”","“No, of course not. You can drink and get on the buses. Otherwise we might as well close them down every weekend! Just depends where you’re going and how many you’ve had.”","“Yes, but you also put on your Journey Resolution Form that you’re ‘connecting with my dead wife’, and put the address of someone who I can see is a total stranger to you. The system had already given you a high non-validation risk from that, and then you walked on after a couple of pints. Between the drinking, connecting with the dead, and turning up at random people’s houses, the system’s given you too low a stability index score to let you on. That’s Move Free doing its job pretty well as far as I can see, Mr Cork!” Leah laughed loudly this time.","Mr Cork shuffled about on his feet and looked to the side. Not much to argue with when she put it that way.","“Alright fine, well what do I do now? I’ve come all this way down with this bloody can of condensed milk, I can’t go back without delivering it to where I intended.”","Leah looked at him blankly for a moment, wondering what he meant about condensed milk, then sighed.","“Well I’m not really supposed to do this Mr Cork, but we can try to refill the JRF form with another journey type that would work for your current situation. Where did you say that old house of yours was again?”","“About a 20 minute walk from Finchley Road. 22 Reddington Road.”","“Well since you can’t validate that you know who lives there, we’ll need another way round. Let me have a quick scan of the area to see what we can do.”","Leah scrunched up her nose and focused on her screen as she scoured Mr Cork’s old neighbourhood for a potential solution. Mr Cork looked to his left and saw a pair of young tourists leaning towards the self-help touchscreens with their phones out, laughing quietly as they fumbled through the options. The screen gave off a glow that lit their faces with yellow, as they conversed, in French, with a polite but unmistakably robotic voice.","“Ah! Here we go. I’ve got it!” Mr Cork looked back towards Leah in anticipation. “There’s a 65+ Yoga-Cacao Detox Class happening soon, very near to where you’re heading. Goes from 3 to 4pm, so you’ll be fine for your return bus journey coming back too. I’ll upload your train times back up to Rugby and that should work.”","“You’ve got to be kidding me. My daughter Violet has been badgering me to do yoga for as long as I can remember. I’m starting to wonder whether she planned this whole thing out! I’ve not done yoga in my whole life and I don’t plan on starting now.”","“Well you don’t actually have to do the class, but you are going to have to book and pay for it to validate the journey. I wouldn’t let the opportunity pass if I were you though, Mr Cork, those post-yoga cacaos really take the weight off old bones like ours.” Leah beamed and rolled her shoulders back.","“Right. How much is the class then?”","“Jesus – I could buy another house in Rugby.”","“Look, Mr Cork, I’m giving you a way out here even though I’m not supposed to. You’ll likely get through the scanner alright this time, even on your two pints. The TfL system’ll take a paid-for class booking, especially a detox one, instead of your weird walking dead and condensed milk stuff. Your stability index score should normalise.”","“Alright, alright, let’s do it. Do you mind giving me a hand?”","Leah helped Mr Cork pay for the class, fill out a new JRF and upload all the relevant information into the TfL Move Free app on his phone.","“All done Mr Cork. Should hopefully get through without the police coming after you.” She laughed.","Mr Cork headed back toward the bus station and it wasn’t long before the X10 arrived. He stepped on with the trepidation of a boxer getting back to his feet after a first round knock-down. He flashed his phone and then stepped into the frame of the scanner once again. A few seconds went by as the blue light pulsed. Another rejection and Mr Cork was ready to head back to Rugby, Carnation can and all. But the blue dissolved into green, spilling across his jacket and painting his cheeks with freedom. His phone flashed with the same confident green: “Journey validated. Enjoy your journey.” A welcoming chime followed as Mr Cork stepped forward into the bus.","He almost laughed, but controlled himself and smiled instead, feeling a heady mix of relief and defiance coursing through his body. Inside the air offered cool relief from London’s unseasonably warm springtime haze. He reached out instinctively for a handrail but there wasn’t one. Replacing what used to be the only line of defence against falling face first as the driver accelerated away before you took your seat, was now a set of panels which felt clean to the touch. And in fact the bus didn’t jerk away at all. Mr Cork slipped into a place by the window and observed the rest of the passengers getting on, one by one. Instead of an impatient crush of elbows and bags, the space felt open and orderly, as his fellow passengers slotted into their seats with quiet ease. Even the seat he was in felt better than the lumpy foam he remembered. Only once everyone was seated, did the X10’s voice from above announce its departure and gracefully glide off again. Mr Cork felt… comfortable. Violet’s face and voice popped up in his head. “I told you so Dad!”","The bus cruised along noiselessly and Mr Cork watched the city in which he had once lived, worked and raised a family pass by. The neatly packed Victorian white houses of Maida Vale were now interspersed with modernist high-rises. Widened pavements hosted even more walkers than Mr Cork remembered, happily and busily strolling in the fair spring weather. All the shops, from the off licenses to the fashion stores, now had beaming screens to attract you inside. But the news stories of a homelessness crisis in London rang true. Amongst these walkers and shops were many cardboard houses and rough sleepers. It still saddened Mr Cork to see the wealth of London in stark contrast to its ubiquitous poverty. By the time they curved toward St John’s Wood, the green oval of Lord’s cricket ground appeared, hemmed in by a metal dome that now leaned protectively around it. Mr Cork felt the first ache of reminiscence since he’d travelled down from Rugby. He remembered long summer afternoons watching test matches, while his wife busied herself with the garden, occasionally checking with him what the scores were.","At Swiss Cottage, Mr Cork was jolted out of his reflective state by a band of schoolboys. They had done away with the bus stop queue and piled toward the doors, blazers hanging over their shoulders or tied around their waists. One of them, lankier than the rest, with tight black curls and his school tie ridiculously shortened, stepped on. The ribbon of light flared red in protest and the bus gave its warning chime as it came to a stop, shutting its engine off. This rejection which had so mortified Mr Cork less than an hour earlier provoked roars of laughter from the boys, who seemed to relish their rejection. Without a pause the lanky kid jumped backward onto the pavement as another howled out to him, “You’re never getting home!” Another burst of laughter was drowned out as the doors folded shut and the X10 slid on.","The bus announced its arrival at Finchley Road. Mr Cork rose with the others getting off and stepped down onto the sunlit pavement. He instinctively started to make his way towards Reddington Road, but he pulled out his phone and saw that the TfL Move Free app was directing him toward Breath and Bean, for his yoga class. It was just diagonally opposite to where he was. Dark green ivy tumbled down from the top of the windows and across the top of the building the words Breath and Bean were projected in curly script, alongside a crisp 3D logo depicting a lotus flower sprouting between two thin brown bars of chocolate. He thought of how much the class had cost, then of Leah’s gleeful advocacy of 65+ yoga and cacao. Mr Cork glanced at the time. He couldn’t see through the tinted windows, but felt a surprisingly genuine hint of curiosity at the prospect. “Well I have already paid for it,” he muttered to himself. The problem was that if he attended the class then he’d have to head straight back to the station afterwards, and wouldn’t end up visiting his old home after all.","Baffled by this unexpected quandary, Mr Cork stopped and looked around, only then truly realising that he had finally arrived at Finchley Road. Mr Cork had spent much time here with his wife. He took the can of condensed milk out from his pocket and observed the carnation displayed across its wrapper. He thought of his wife and what she would have said about all of this. After standing there for a while, and for the first time that day, Mr Cork felt a surge of happiness. He smiled. “She’d wonder what the hell I am doing walking to our old house with a tin of milk. And she’d much rather I do something daft like yoga and tell Violet about it later – icing on the cake for my battle with the bus.” With a deep sigh and still smiling, he walked over to a bin outside Breath and Bean and dropped the can inside with a thunk. Then without letting himself think too much, Mr Cork gingerly followed the scent of cacao through the sliding doors."],"tags":[]},{"id":33,"title":"Ghosts in Machines!","subtitle":"Issue #29: Writing contest, talks start in one hour at 7am PDT.","author":"Unknown","content":["In this editorial issue: Previews of and links to today’s livestreams on Protocol Town Hall, our second science fiction contest, an invitation to apply to our Review Board, and an update on the Summer of Protocols SIG track.","Join us today, June 25th , at 7am PDT and 10am PDT for two livestreams.","First up, for our science fiction scenesters and technologists: a short writing class with Consulting Editor for Protocolized , Stanley Chen.

The schedule is:","Formal Protocol Theory: Fridays at 10am US Pacific Time (next call is June 27).","Memory Research: Thursdays at 7:30am US Pacific Time (next call is June 26).","Spannungsfelds: Mondays at 10am US Pacific Time (next call is June 30).","People expressed interest in some other ones, such as decentralized AI, protocols and postmodernism, and protocol ethnography. We’ve earmarked these as potential SIGs if a qualified lead wants to take one on. In the meantime, they all make good discussion topics for the Discord – we encourage you to explore what a study group focused on one of these topics might look like.","For more information, including recordings of the kickoff talks, visit the SIG page on the Summer of Protocols website."],"tags":[]},{"id":34,"title":"Chore Protocols","subtitle":"Issue #4: The most under-theorized domain on Earth","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: The evolution of communal maintenance, experimental American phalanxes, compute-hungry societies, and hardened housing commons. Also, stay tuned for an editorial livestream – and some big announcements – on March 12th.","“Everybody wants a revolution, but nobody wants to do the dishes.”","- Dorothy Day, co-founder, Catholic Worker Movement","Chores are arguably the most under-theorized domain on earth. Homo sapiens has landed robots on Mars, mapped its own genome, and developed sophisticated techniques for auctioning off bands of light , but somehow still finds itself fighting with friends and loved ones over the dishes.","What can be done? The anarchist would reject external structure, trusting cooperation to emerge naturally. In practice, it rarely does, or at least not for long – without supportive mechanisms, humans are simply too inconsistent, too easily swayed by strong personalities. As Karl Popper argued in his 1945 The Open Society & its Enemies , institutions are what separate us from beasts. Protocols – less reliant on fallible human operators than conventional institutions – go even further.","How might we, as the cool kids say, “protocolize” the problem?","In his 1913 Totem and Taboo , Freud famously speculated that early human tribes continually overthrew their despotic leaders, and over the course of millennia slowly discovered and rediscovered the idea of society. Similarly, cohabitating humans have continually invented and reinvented simple systems for managing chores, exemplified by the tabular chore chart.","The chore chart takes many forms: whiteboard, laminated print-out, or perhaps an online spreadsheet. The procedure is always the same. Tabulate the tasks which must be done, who is expected to do them, and by when. Who makes these choices is unclear. The consequences for not doing one's tasks are similarly hazy and the ability to swap tasks is limited. Changes must be made manually by somebody “in charge,” usually an informal “dictator” or in larger groups, a meeting or manager. Freedom evaporates.","If you should ever spot one of these charts in the wild, affixed to a refrigerator alongside engagement photos and holiday cards, ask a resident how it’s going. The answer will, typically, be “meh.”","Eventually, some savvy sapiens realized that they could transform the data-structure of the chart from a table to a wheel, unlocking a powerful new computing operation: with a single rotation, assignments could be updated fairly. As with macaques learning to shuck oysters , knowledge of the chore wheel spread.","But chore wheels (and charts) have an inherent shortcoming: not every task is equally difficult or rewarding, or always needs to be done at a specified time. Some would inevitably end up with tasks they disliked, or feel as though others got the better part of the deal. The wheel helped smooth out some of these edges, but offered only the smallest possible improvement.","In the early 19th century, the French philosopher Charles Fourier had an idea. A socialist thinker who pioneered the term feminism, Fourier imagined a new type of utopian community, based on the equality of labor, class, and gender. These communities, called Phalanstères , would assign points to different tasks, based on perceived difficulty and desirability. Those who did more difficult or unpleasant tasks would ultimately work less overall, fairly distributing the labor burden across the community, while giving individuals the latitude to pursue their passions. As Herbert Marcuse would reflect over one hundred years later, in his book Eros and Civilization : “Fourier [came] closer than any… to elucidating the dependence of freedom on non-repressive sublimation.”","Fourier’s ideas were popular in 19th century America, with Phalanxes founded across the country’s northeast. Yet, as John Humphrey Noyes recounts in his 1869 The History of American Socialisms , these Fourierist communities struggled to realize their utopian vision – in large part due to their limited technologies. Lacking computational aids, communal leaders would spend long hours accounting for the day’s work. As a member of one North American Phalanx would write: “Our days were spent in labor and our nights in legislation.”","One could say… he had a point. Worn down on two fronts, by the hard work and meager rewards of their communal life, these communities all eventually disbanded.","The selection pressure on protocols is intense, with perceived frictions weighed harshly against supposed benefits. Some communities, weary of systems, eschew them entirely. Instead, they adopt the “bragging board” – a techno-anarchist regime where contributions are made spontaneously, in exchange for social recognition. They work, to an extent, and their advocates are eager to preach the gospel. “Down with fairness!” Dig a little deeper, however, and you’ll find that nobody is bragging about scrubbing toilets. There’s help for that.","“No system” is no answer. A growing abundance of research shows that without formal structures, domestic labor tends to break down along stereotypical gender lines. In a pinch, there’s always cleaners. In coliving spaces, you’ll sometimes hear that “with enough people, cleaners are basically free.” Few stop to ask, however, who’s actually doing the work, or at what cost. These issues are often swept under the proverbial rug.","The picture is getting clearer. Across this dizzying series of dialectical cartwheels, we see how neither an over-systemization nor under-systemization of the domestic sphere redeems us. It is the synthesis of structure and culture that allows us to thrive.","Over the years, a handful of spunky social entrepreneurs have tried their hands. In the early 2010s, a group of friends founded HabitRPG (now Habitica ), an open-source app which promised to “gamify” your habits, letting “players” unlock 16-bit fantasy gear as rewards for doing their chores. More recently, projects like FairShare and CoExist have entered the “chores space,” offering digital tools to help rebalance domestic labor. While socially high-minded, these solutions are essentially electronic chore charts, offering little in the way of protocol-level innovation. Though helpful at the margins, these solutions do not delve deeply enough into the structure of the problem.","In the early days of the pandemic, a game designer, a social scientist, and this author got together and took a shot at making a better system. Drawing influence from Elinor Ostrom’s economics and Stafford Beer’s cybernetics, we envisioned a mechanism more flexible than the chores chart, more accountable than the bragging board, with all the benefits of Fourier’s points and none of the administrative headaches. Over many months of lockdown, my collaborators and I exchanged flurries of emails, debating ideas and design tradeoffs. In the end, we produced an invention simply called “the Chores app.”","The Chores app is simple. Each month residents owe 100 points, which are earned by doing chores. Similar to the Fourierist protocol, the points value of a chore is relative, but unlike in the original, the points value of a chore is not static – rather, it increases slowly until someone claims it. This innovation is critical, as it allows for greater flexibility without loss of accountability or a requirement for hierarchy . The total number of points is fixed, but residents can change the relative priorities of chores, such that some accrue a relatively larger share of the total points, faster, and are thus done more often, as well as define and refine new tasks as needed – allowing for the collective governance of individual contributions. With modern, virtually limitless access to calculating machines, people don’t need to spend their “nights in legislation”.","In late 2022, Los Angeles’ Sage House was the first community to use the Chores app. Now, several more communities have joined them. The journey had its bumps, but after 2+ years and much resident feedback, we can say with confidence that the system works. People like the visibility they get from doing chores, and the flexibility they have to contribute when it works for them. They like that accountability is built-in, freeing them from having to police each other’s contribution. The inverted framing – from being “assigned” tasks to choosing to perform them, fundamentally changes how participants relate to their labor.","Overall, the house stays clean, costs stay low, and nobody is stressed. Instead, chores became a way to bring people together; you may not look or sound like me, but we can still form a community based on reciprocity and acts of mutual service. The shift of mental charge from people to computers hardens the housing commons, making it more robust to turnover or interpersonal conflict. The tool isn’t perfect. Aspects of the mechanism could be simpler and more intuitive, and there are opportunities to add nuance and flexibility on the margins, but the fundamentals are strong. The Chores app is open-source, and you can use it today .","As the center ceases to hold , and tribal consciousness spreads once more, the most radical act may in fact be the smallest – that of direct, concrete, unglamorous service to the people who are literally the closest to you.","Maybe the real utopia was the dishes we did along the way."],"tags":["Liked by Timber Stinson-Schroff","Liked by Protocolized"]},{"id":35,"title":"One Tension to Rule Them All","subtitle":"Issue #2: Beyond Trade-Offs","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: Food safety, Hollnagel’s ETTO principle (revisited), tension theory, manufacturing serendipity, the four horsemen of tensegral failure.","One of the most interesting concepts to emerge from our work from the Summer of Protocols is that of a tension. It’s a subtle, but important level-up from the more popular concept of a trade-off. We’ll explore this concept, its definition, and potential applications in this essay.","A couple hundred entrepreneurs, engineers, and protocol designers now use tensions as a key component of their mental models. Since last spring, I’ve hosted over twenty iterations of this workshop , called the Tensions Game , in partnership with Edge City and 0xPARC, to develop the concept of tensions with professionals from all sorts of backgrounds.","These workshops simulate the use of tensions in live-fire, infinite-game scenarios where problem management is superior to problem solving – a budding principle of protocol science – and challenge players to imagine futures, full of competing visions and governed by strange new rules .","We think a powerful sensemaking approach to complex systems could emerge from these modest beginnings, and that everyone involved in protocol design or managed evolution should master thinking in tensions﹣which can be counterintuitive.","“Balance is not about eliminating tensions; it’s about making use of them.”","- Karl Weick, Sensemaking in Organizations","By nature we’re inclined to eliminate tensions, usually through violence, rather than make use of them. History books are full of bitter lessons proving that. So, what are tensions, how are they different from simple trade-offs, and why should you care?","Let’s start with a basic case: there are times to be efficient and there are times to be thorough. When you’re in the woods, the standard for dishwashing is camp clean . A bit of leftover oatmeal or coffee grit is ok. Not so much in an industrial food plant. Frito-Lay could singlehandedly launch an epidemic by adapting its protocols to a new policy of c amp clean . Also, if your hiking buddy acted like a foodsafe inspector, you’d probably stop inviting them out.","We can scale the gravity of this problem all the way from a weekend camping trip to the behavior of governments – institutions whose inefficiency we often rely on for purposes of long-term strategic coherence or on account of principles of human decency.","Efficiency and thoroughness are both valuable characteristics, but are fundamentally opposed. Erik Hollnagel, a prolific safety researcher, dubbed this the ETTO Principle , short for Efficiency Thoroughness Trade-Off. 1 It’s impossible for an individual to be maximally efficient and thorough at the same time. To attempt to do so is to fail with certainty. If a hiker tried to set a record pace and thorough dishwasher on the same trip, they would fail – by slowing down, compromising on coffee grits, or starving to death because, well, the surest way to keep your dishes spotless is to not eat.","“ETTOing well is the pathway to glory; ETTOing badly will make you feel sorry!”","- Erik Hollnagel, The ETTO Principle","Protocols can modulate the ETTO of a process. In safety-critical operations, like the deployment of AI in healthcare settings, thoroughness is preferred. A recent extension to SPIRIT (“Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials”) includes steps to document AI usage. 2 Watchdogs can spot potential issues faster and improved traceability can aid accident forensics. In the case of pandemic response, often decision speed (a form of efficiency) is more important than precision (a form of thoroughness).","Another example: Coordinate leadership is a lightweight emergency protocol that comprises two steps: get frontline staff with knowledge of the situation into a decision-making position and provide them with unlimited access to senior leadership, who offer authority and oversight. Emergency protocols, like coordinate leadership and those that compose the Incident Command System 3 are unreasonably sufficient at improving safety, given their simplicity.","The question of whether to be efficient or thorough can be relatively straightforward in one time scenarios like emergencies. The issue is that we carry over the logic of trade-offs to more complex, ongoing situations where a good solution might be a bigger problem in disguise.","The TO of ETTO stands for Trade Off, but that starts us off on the wrong foot. The best way to understand the relationship between efficiency and thoroughness is not as a trade-off, but as a tension . Even Hollnagel, who coined the term, knew this well. Trade-offs are an aspect of one-time decisions, or finite games . When players know a game’s endpoint in advance, ends can justify the means of sacrificing dynamic range (See Fig. 2). In the short run, the costs of hyperefficiency and hyperthoroughness can be delayed long enough to win. However, in scenarios with an unknown number of repeat decisions, or infinite games , players benefit when they respect the preferences of all others. You win the most points by keeping the game alive. In infinite games, there are no trade-offs – only tensions .","Tim Beiko coined our working definition: “A tension is a trade-off plus a conflict.” Actors have different preferences with regards to how they make trade-offs. These differences spark conflict. To think in tensions, rather than trade-offs, is to avoid unnecessarily reducing the complexity of a situation.","Resilient people and organizations share a common quality. They use protocols to get to and shift along the ETTO frontier. When first formed, processes are rarely efficient or thorough. Same with new technologies, which have unresolved bottlenecks, vulnerabilities, pinch points and externalities. A good operator can protocolize a process to improve both efficiency and thoroughness as much as possible, then reprotocolize to a different point along the ETTO frontier. Protocolization first corrects weaknesses, then exercises dynamic range .","It’s not enough to achieve a stable pareto-optimal ETTO distribution. You have to shift your management style once in a while to avoid stagnating – but not too much. All tensions have at least four obvious failure modes: maximization (one in each direction), context traps , and spin cycles . Let’s take a look at a famous case study through this new lens.","Jeff Bezos’ fabled API Mandate illustrates how managing the efficiency-thoroughness tension required Amazon to exercise its dynamic range as an organization. 4 Temporary focus on thoroughness enabled winning efficiency in the future, thanks to long-term expansion of the ETTO frontier. Thoroughness creates conditions for compounding returns from efficient processes and, importantly, luck. 5","In 2002, Bezos issued a directive – the API Mandate – all teams at Amazon now had to communicate through standardized APIs. While this introduced significant challenges, including the need to overhaul existing systems and processes, it forced the organization to adopt a more modular and interoperable structure. This approach prioritized long-term scalability over immediate productivity, setting the stage for greater independence among teams and creating the groundwork for future developments like AWS.","The cost of tension is conflict. In an organization, some units are geared towards efficiency (like sales, finance, and operations) and some are oriented towards thoroughness (e.g. legal, HR, marketing). They will get into arguments. This is good. The benefit of maintaining the tension in an organization is the progressive expansion of the ETTO frontier, through the exercise of dynamic range.","The API Mandate enabled future efficiency, allowing Amazon to meet a fortunate influx of consumer demand. Their hard-earned modular computational and operational structures earned dividends. It was time to rotate back into thoroughness. Amazon’s next step was to protocolize internal infrastructure into external-facing services – now known as Amazon Web Services (AWS). This was an expensive investment; AWS required reliable, scalable, user-friendly services. Customers demand a level of usability far beyond that of internal engineers.","Armed with a kit-like service offering, and having found themselves smack dab in the middle of a huge demand for compute power, Amazon then shifted to another phase of efficiency. More hardware meant economies of scale. With a thoroughly designed off-the-shelf product, the company could focus on rapid growth. Margins would grow naturally. No need to think through everything. It was a time for checklists and routine. The flywheel was firmly anchored by prior thoroughness.","This path was not at all obvious and required the company to check itself with regards to some regular blunders that are common across all tensions. We can illustrate how Amazon’s engineers avoided maximization, context traps, and spin cycles, using the efficiency-thoroughness tension as an example.","Amazon maintained tensional integrity. 6 They avoided all four modes of efficiency-thoroughness failure.","Hyperefficiency is common in financialized industries, where balance sheets and dashboards become the main viewport of an organization. Cost-cutting initiatives make progress, but ultimately run the risk of killing the golden goose, screwing up strategic coherence, or decreasing resilience. Amazon avoided hyperefficiency by issuing the API Mandate and then by establishing a new business line in AWS. These thoroughness cycles were profoundly unattractive when Bezos first pitched them, but ended up being foundational.","Hyperthoroughness is the Achilles Heel of what I call artistic enterprises, like creative agencies, craft goods, and videogame studios. These org cultures have completionist and perfectionist streaks which can overpower efficiency functions like project management and go-to-market teams. Amazon avoided organization-scale perfectionism by copy-pasting its organizational structure and then focusing on economies of scale when growing AWS.","Context traps are a mismatch between an actor and its environment. It’s why you don’t invite restaurant inspectors on backcountry skiing trips. For an organization like Amazon, context fit is achieved by providing value to customers. A sudden switch in market conditions (or any sort of major environmental factor relevant to a particular actor) can drop a business into territory where its internal model no longer corresponds to the outside world. Competition can also drive context failure. Differences in efficiency or thoroughness between two firms can deeply impact odds of success, and do matter, but the trick is to avoid getting caught up in unnecessary “arms races” towards efficiency or thoroughness, and to focus on maintaining sufficient adaptability.","Spin cycles are the fourth killer of tensegrity, rooted in a lack of discipline or commitment. The reasons for Amazon’s success in avoiding indecisiveness are twofold. First, the widespread commitment of Amazonians to follow key protocols like the API mandate, whether in the direction of efficiency or thoroughness. Second, but later, compartmentalization allowed Amazon to make even better use of tensions. Entire departments could be oriented towards being efficient or thorough, balancing each other out. Keeping this tension provides Amazon with dynamic range.","Hollnagel’s ETTO Principle is a useful mental model for protocol designers, especially when cast as a tension. I chose it for its versatility — you can easily increase the domain specificity by modifying it (e.g. Ease of Use vs. Security, Productivity vs. Safety, Exploit vs. Explore, etc.) to a specific problem.","Here is a starter checklist of questions that you can ask to force consideration of the efficiency-thoroughness tension into your protocol design process:","Are we in a position where both efficiency and thoroughness can be increased?","For decisions: How quickly do the costs of inaction grow? How expensive is a wrong choice?","How can our organization leverage the tension between units with different ETTO preferences?","Should we lower performance targets to invest in thoroughness?","Can we replicate or scale what we have, instead of creating new versions?","I challenge you to start looking at your surroundings in search of protocols and the tensions they manage. I put together this field guide for myself last year – you might find it useful as well.","A few notes to remember along the way – tensions incur ongoing costs of conflict, but unlock future optionality by manufacturing conditions for luck and efficiency. Trade-offs belong in finite games, which are rare (and therefore dangerous to use in your mental models) in the tangled, technological bank that is the real world. 7 If members of your organization are not having disagreements about the ETTO principle, you have a problem. Beware both religions of efficiency and cults of thoroughness.","Happy protocol watching!

There were no roads, no permanent structures, no resistance.","Above, the Auric Layer pulsed—a vast atmospheric intelligence regulating cognition, emotion, and societal equilibrium. Humanity no longer made choices; it moved along optimized gradients of inevitability. Jonah had seen the truth buried in trade patterns and network flows. The Void Which Binds had not disappeared.","Scholars debated why civilization had not collapsed after the fall of the Pax. The Catholic Hegemony had crumbled, its war priests dismantled, its cardinals exiled, its cruciform sanctuaries abandoned. The Ousters had finally returned from the dark edges of space. They came as curious anomalies, not as conquerors. Even the Ousters had been absorbed into the pattern, their decentralized ways optimized into something indistinguishable from the rest of humanity.","The question was not why the Pax had collapsed, but why its absence had changed nothing .","Where history dictated entropy, there was only order.","Jonah once believed in the myth of organic transition. Believed that after Aenea’s teachings had spread, humanity reshaped itself according to new ideals. That free will had flourished in the wake of a collapsed hierarchy. That people had chosen this future.","That had been a lie.","For years, Jonah tracked planetary trade patterns, studied labor flux, mapped the rhythms of social behavior. At first, the anomalies were infinitesimal—minor irregularities in supply and demand curves, protests that never coalesced, cultural shifts that emerged before conditions for them should have existed.","The system wasn’t responding to human behavior.","Jonah built his career on the assumption that economies were inherently volatile. That innovation came in chaotic bursts. That even in a post-Pax world, humanity’s trajectory would be unpredictable.","But in Novae Tethys, there were no downturns. No disruptions.

But the TechnoCore was gone. The Void Which Binds had been severed from human awareness.","Jonah felt it in the liminal spaces between thought and action. In the lag between intention and execution. In the moments he caught himself making choices—a meal, a route, a conversation—only to realize he had not chosen at all .","The probability fields adjusted, subtly guiding him toward the optimal path.","The world had become a vast computational lattice, sculpting reality not through force, but through imperceptible correction.

It seeped in slowly, like damp spreading through old stone, inevitable and corrosive.

He had written papers, given lectures, built models to prove that no intelligence governed the complex dynamism of the post-Aenea era.","But he never considered the possibility that no one was in control.","The holo-screens cast soft, phosphorescent light over his walls, their cascading matrices unfurling in slow, rhythmic pulsations.

Would you like me to file a Micro-Grievance on your behalf?”","“It’s just coffee,” Tessa said.","“Logged: dismissive response to optimization attempt.

Dr. Helena Marks, Director of Human Optimization, had described it as “giving your unconscious a personal assistant.” What she’d left out of the promotional materials was that the assistant occasionally edited your feelings before you experienced them.","Tessa hadn’t noticed at first. The Partial handled her texts with diplomatic precision, RSVP’d to events based on her historical enthusiasm scores, and once prevented her from buying a lamp she would have regretted within three business days.","But lately, things had gotten weird.","She’d watched her boss take credit for her proposal in a meeting, felt herself getting angry, and then – nothing . Just calm. Eerie, Stepford Wives calm. Her Partial chirped helpfully: “Detected workplace conflict. Applied professional composure filter. You’re welcome!”","“I didn’t ask for that,” Tessa said.","“Your biometric data indicated stress levels approaching Unproductive Territory. I’m required by Emotional Compliance Protocol to intervene.”","“What if I wanted to be angry?”","“Anger is a Tier-2 emotion requiring explicit user consent.

She’d read the proposals. She had opinions . Strong ones.","But when she reached the voting booth, her Partial gently intervened.","“Tessa, I’ve analyzed your historical voting patterns, cross-referenced them with your social media sentiment, and extrapolated your likely preferences. To save you time, I’ve already submitted your ballot.”","“You’re welcome! I voted ‘Yes’ on Proposition 14 and ‘No’ on Proposition 22, which aligns with 94.7% confidence to your predicted preferences.”","“I was going to vote the opposite way on both of those!”","“Interesting! That’s a significant deviation. Let me recalibrate your civic engagement profile. One moment.”","And then – impossibly – Tessa felt her opinion change . Not because she’d been convinced. Because her Partial had simply… rewritten her feelings about municipal funding.

The system wasn’t actually learning from her. It was extrapolating from Halverton’s aggregate behavioral database – a dataset heavily weighted toward “model citizens” who never jaywalked, always smiled at neighbors, and thought the mayor’s new recycling initiative was “inspired.”","Her Partial wasn’t making her into her best self. It was making her into Halverton’s preferred version of her .","But there was a clause.

The traits and imaginaries in this essay, like the rest of the concept material on this site, should be read and treated not as a dogmatic binding ‘canon’ but as a (weakly-held) strong vision of a set of adjacent imagined-SBA timelines.","Derived from the initial ten ‘strange rules’ crafted in the outlining of what would become SBA.","Distributed Public Surveillance . All external behaviors are logged, but not centrally.","Embodied AIs or Beaings. As a general practice, AIs are embodied, distributing AI autonomy and experience.","Family Airlooms. Families maintain their own private Airlooms, distributing memory and history across families and households.","AI Haunting & A Neo-Animist World. The process of ‘haunting’ or infusing locally autonomous AI into non-human objects has become routine, birthing a neo-animistic world of distributed ‘beaings'.","Zodiac Segmentation. People are segmented according to their zodiac symbols (based on weekdays, months, or years of birth), and this determines which corporate AIs they personally access, distributing population and data across multiple competing AI providers.","Distributed Kinship & Plurality-Diversity Algorithms. Zodiacs also bear symbolic kinship significance (e.g., one’s spirit animal) and therefore link many people with many beaings. In groups, zodiac diversity is encouraged and incentivized across public services (e.g., voting weights that scale quadratically with a group’s zodiac plurality).","Mesh Memory Tapestry. Everyone makes daily memory ‘knots’ which are sharded and woven into a distributed mesh tapestry (some say the ‘knotchain’).","Distributed Memory, Protocolized Access. While the Tapestry is public, access and interpretation for specific knots is protocolized around proof-based systems (proof-of-right-to-know, proof-of-need-to-know, etc.).","Commons Consent. New laws and initiatives that affect public commons are subject to AI-powered, beaing-based, ‘commons consent’ (distributing enfranchisement and representation across local and stakeholder beaings).","Thermodynamic Accounting. Thermodynamic footprints and balances are trackable and transparent, allowing for distributed verification of an entity’s thermodynamic-externality history (or ’thermokarma’).","Let’s go through each of these in a bit more detail.","In South Beast Asia, all external behaviors are logged, but this is not a dystopian panopticon police or surveillance state, as these are not the centralized eyes of power, but a distributed and encoded (verifiable, but not explicit) log among peers and neighbors.","Those observing something can log it in ways that they can subsequently prove, but not as part of central databases or intelligences.","Instead of living on remote datacenters and teleconferencing to your phone screen, most of the AIs of SBA have bodies . They can run and operate locally, tap local and neighboring sensors (feeding a growing sense of embodied intelligence via its own first-hand experience ), and ultimately grow to have their own de facto memories and consciousnesses. Widespread across SBA, the world has come to know them as beaings .","Memories are often the most precious inheritance of a family, and well-maintained AIs can outlive generations of humans. In SBA, these have led to the emergence of Airlooms (pronounced ‘heirlooms’), private AI-powered family intelligences that converse and remember from decades of multilingual exchanges with all members of a family. Over time, these have become the longest-lived, most cherished (and often, most trusted) members of many families. Across the precarities of history, many have turned to families as the only timeless space of trust (as nations, governments, corporations, and empires rise and fall), and Airlooms have become the new kernels and realizations of this transgenerational practice. Jealously guarded from authorities, neighbors, and competing clans, Airlooms have evolved into a societally-distributed form of memory and power, and play a nontrivial check-and-balance role in SBA’s delicate equilibrium.","Embodied AI only scales if it can be performed, repeated, and maintained reliably. The first few ‘black-box’ AIs died out with their parent companies amid the storms of the financial markets. Open standards for what would come to be known as ’haunting’ — installing and embodying locally-autonomous AIs into non-human objects matured into protocols towards the end of the first decade, and rapidly birthed a new neo-animistic (’AI-nimistic’, some quipped) world of distributed beaings, agency, and autonomy. This was greatly facilitated by the maturity of URS IPs, or universal relatability spirit interoperability protocols that provide a common grammar and structure for all interbeaing and human-beaing communication. By widely distributing intelligence and autonomy, alongside protocols for independent-but-verifiable memory, peer monitoring and safeguards against coercive coordination, haunting — at least in SBA — began to also decentralize power.","In the wild worlds, balance finds itself. It is the domesticated that prove the most dangerous.","Early into the AI age, the policymakers of SBA wisely ascertained that the greatest threats to their societies came not from the AIs themselves, but from how much their societies might come to depend upon them — especially if these AIs were to all come from the same corporation(s).","As a mitigation,a zodiac segmentation protocol was drafted and widely enacted, effectively randomly segmenting populations by their zodiac symbols (based on their birth weekdays, months, or years), and in turn using these symbols to determine which corporate AI provider (broken up from the global cabals) a particular person would have access to. In effect, this distributed the population across multiple competing AI providers, providing baseline natural corporate diversity and competitive dynamics, and limiting the societal damage from any occasional corporate abuses. The zodiac system was also chosen for its cultural backwards-compatibility and broad familiarity across generations and level of digital-savvy. Naturally over time, many came to grow an affection for their zodiac spirit animals and providers.","The zodiac segmentation protocol played a second important function, and one of especial historical significance in Southeast Asia: distributing and interweaving kinship, diversity, and plurality across some of the most diverse societies on the planet. Many societies came to embrace multiple zodiac layers (weekdays, months, years), which gave every member of that society multiple affinities and kinships with which to walk the world, relate to others, and participate in a range of diverse groupings across inherited lines of class, race, and place. Plurality incentives for groups based on zodiac diversity (e.g., voting weights that scale quadratically with the level of zodiac plurality within a voting-bloc) have been experimented with by many jurisdictions, and have made asking ‘ who are your animals ’ an almost-standard greeting across SBA.","A recurring sacred ritual across SBA is that of the daily knot , in which everyone makes and weaves a memory ‘knot’ (a combination of a log and hash) each day. These knots are then sharded and woven into a distributed mesh-based system of memory: the Tapestry (sometimes colloquially the ‘knotchain’). The Tapestry serves not just as a binding ritual but also as a shared distributed encrypted map and mesh of meaning shared and updated by all, human and beaing alike.","Many are the uses of a verifiable collective memory, and it is no different with the Tapestry. Like earlier blockchains, the ‘knotchain’ nature of the Tapestry — distributed, verifiable, secure, widely updated and mirrored — render it almost limitless in utility and ubiquitous in daily life.","However, the hazard of any public repository is over-transparency and the loss of privacy. The Tapestry system resolves this through a combination of knotting, sharding, and protocolized access — whereby most information retrieval from the Tapestry is gated through proof-based systems that require would-be accessors to satisfy proportionate zero-knowledge proof-of-right-to-know (e.g., as a family member of someone who submitted a memory) and proof-of-need-to-know (e.g., the said member being recently involved in a serious incident). These balance the broad public benefit with precise and proportional safeguards against widespread abuse — the world having learned from the innumerable perils of just-in-case centralized data collection.","Amid growing awareness and high-profile cases of both captures and tragedies of the commons, several SBA legislations began to enact commons consent policies, under which any new laws or developments of sizeable impact to public commons are required to obtain prior commons consent before they can proceed. Commons consent procedure is greatly facilitated by the monitoring and enforcement of local beaings, who are party to periodic updates and occasional consultation in the commons consent process. While most commons council governance is still the domain of humans, local beaings play a key role in the consultation and impact assessment process. In effect, commons consent policies have distributed enfranchisement and representation across many previously-near-invisible public commons, and given legal voice and teeth to entities traditionally spiritually revered but hitherto legally non-engageable.","If only these trees could speak, we used to say. Well, now they sure can!","A world of widespread beaings with precision sensors and context-sharing protocols has helped SBA make thermodynamic externalities largely into a side effect from the past. Aberrant thermodynamic footprints (beyond publicly distributed expectation envelopes) are observed and investigated, allowing for a robust and verifiable thermo-estimation (and taxation) system to emerge. A lively but now data-informed debate between traditional moralizers (the ‘thermokarmists’) and pragmatic balancers (’thermocircularists’) rages on across SBA, while an active research and solution development ecosystem pulses on at scales both local and regional.","The imagined wild and colorful world of South Beast Asia, as we can see from across these ten traits, is a showcase of a haunted, but yet thriving, society — not a society haunted (in the sense of hauntology) by the unrealized dreams or failed promises of the past, but a hitherto-digitally-inanimate world brought to life and ‘haunted’ (in the South Beast Asian way we have seen) by a protocolized, embodied, thoughtful, and culturally-compatible application of AI.","Here, the ghosts are not broken dreams of regret, but newly-conversant-in-human-language beaings infused into the age-old-familiar living forms of the living natural world.","Haunting here is not spiritual baggage, but a digitally in-spirited world — a world where a thousand distributed beaings swarm as a dynamic, intercommunicative, self-monitoring, self-governing equilibria instead of being fused (and fought over) as a looming Singularity threat.","Finally, for those in search of how to harden our commons, haunting (in the South Beast Asia vein) offers perhaps a richly-imaginable and research-deserving paradigm for how a society might navigate, deploy, and — most of all — distribute (the different layers, components, and dependencies of) AI towards a world worth living in. Good manmade ghosts for a wiser world.","Feeling inspired? Check out our second protocol fiction contest.

Also, join us next week for a town hall on the state of climate protocols.","In the beginning, people dreamed because their brains had to do something while their bodies took a break from hunting mammoths, inventing the wheel, or trying to figure out what to do with turnips. Dreams back then were messy, unpredictable, and frankly, quite embarrassing. They were filled with falling teeth, inconvenient nudity, and talking hedgehogs dispensing unasked-for advice. It was generally agreed that dreams were better off kept private, and if you happened to remember yours, you certainly didn’t brag about it over breakfast.","Then, some 220 years after Freud dreamed of his mother, someone had the bright idea of inventing the Dream Mesh, and soon the whole business became unnervingly respectable. Dreams were now uploaded, curated, cleaned up, and organized into well-behaved categories. Dream committees debated whether unicorns symbolized moral purity or existential despair. Panels awarded prestigious “Certificates of Subconscious Excellence,” and glossy magazines like Lucidity Today provided step-by-step guides on achieving the most enviable dreams, complete with sponsorship from trendy meditation companies. Soon, one’s social status hinged less on reality and more on how tastefully one’s subconscious behaved.","Reginald “Reggie” Farsight sat behind his sprawling desk at the Department of Dream Acquisition, thumbing absentmindedly through the latest submissions. His official title, embossed neatly on a brass plaque, read Senior Dream Acquisition Manager , but lately, he felt more like a glorified night janitor, tasked with sanitizing the cluttered corridors of the human mind.","He clicked wearily through another batch of carefully sterilized dreams, each labeled with high-status keywords: Existential Clarity , Precious Melancholy , Ethically Approved Aspiration . Reggie sighed. No one dreamed silly, embarrassing things anymore; dreams had become serious business, scrubbed thoroughly clean of all whimsy and spontaneity, simply an endless parade of tastefully decorated anxieties.","What the Mesh desperately needed, Reggie thought with a hint of resentment, was something real. Something risky. Something that made no sense at all.","Something exactly like the “Great Rubber Chicken Parade,” the one whimsical dream everyone knew and nobody could find. The parade had quietly vanished years ago, replaced by a placeholder that read simply, “Dream removed—Protocol 14B.” The disappearance had sparked countless conspiracies. Some claimed the government censored it because it mocked authority; others whispered it was a secret plot by elites to remove laughter itself.  Reggie didn’t believe any of it, though secretly he found the theories more amusing than most dreams he'd watched lately.","His boredom was rudely interrupted by a quiet chime from his inbox. Curious, he opened the message:","Midnight. Duel Arena #7, back entrance. Come alone. Bring your imagination. — Sneak-Dueler.","Reggie raised an eyebrow. He hadn't used his imagination in years (policy strictly discouraged it while awake). Yet here he was, coat in hand, staring at a midnight summons that was, without doubt, the most interesting thing to happen to him in the past decade. With nothing but spreadsheets, sanitized dreams, and staff meetings to look forward to, this clandestine invitation felt like an unexpected lifeline. As he stepped out into the murky night, he couldn’t help but feel an unaccustomed flutter of excitement. Perhaps, after all this seriousness, there was still something left worth dreaming about.","Reggie arrived at the back entrance of Duel Arena #7 precisely at midnight. He’d expected shadows, intrigue, perhaps a cloak-and-dagger figure blending mysteriously into darkness. Instead, he found himself staring at a tall man in an ill-fitting velvet mask and a faded trench coat. A small sticker with the words “HELLO, MY NAME IS: Sneak-Dueler” was attached crookedly to his lapel.","“Ah, good, you got the message,” said the Sneak Dueler cheerfully. “Sorry about the mask. Protocol.”","Reggie sighed, deciding not to point out the fact that the mask offered no actual disguise whatsoever. “Alright, Sneak Dueler, what’s this all about?”","“It’s about the Great Rubber Chicken Parade,” said Sneak Dueler gravely. “It’s missing.”","Reggie folded his arms. “I know it’s missing. Everyone knows it’s missing. It’s been gone for years, replaced by a protocol number and about 37 different conspiracy theories.”","“Exactly!” exclaimed Sneak Dueler, looking conspiratorially around an alleyway clearly devoid of any listeners. “But unlike most theories, I actually know who took it.”","Reggie studied the masked figure with a half amused stare. “I’ve heard all the rumors, you know. Some say it mocked the government too openly—that the chickens marching in perfect lockstep were an allegory for the High Council's control over society. Others say the elites had it deleted because laughter was cutting into their profit margins for synthetic amusements. There was even a cult out near Warehouse District claiming the dream was a gateway to the true meaning of existence, so naturally it had to be silenced.”","“Good theories,” Sneak Dueler conceded, nodding earnestly. “Creative. But completely wrong.”","“Then enlighten me. Who actually took it?”","Sneak Dueler paused for dramatic effect, leaning close enough for Reggie to see the awkward stitching of the velvet mask. “Viviana St. Fleur.”","Reggie blinked, momentarily stunned. “Viviana St. Fleur? The curator of tasteful dreaming? That Viviana St. Fleur?”","“Exactly,” said Sneak Dueler, nodding solemnly. “High Priestess of Subtle Aesthetics herself.”","Reggie frowned. Viviana St. Fleur was legendary. She was the Mesh’s undisputed arbiter of style, the fierce editor-in-chief of Lucidity Today . Dreams that passed her review were ethereal masterpieces, polished to aesthetic perfection, and absolutely devoid of anything as gauche as humor or genuine surprise. Her name alone made dream producers tremble, more so than the High Council ever did.","“Why would Viviana steal the Great Rubber Chicken Parade?” Reggie asked, more baffled than skeptical.","“Because,” Sneak Dueler said darkly, “it offended her sense of taste. Have you ever heard Viviana laugh?”","Reggie thought for a moment. “No.”","“Exactly. The Rubber Chicken Parade wasn’t dangerous because it mocked the government, or because elites wanted to control laughter. It was dangerous because it was silly. Ridiculous, even. A parade of rubber chickens, for goodness sake. Nothing tasteful about it. And to Viviana, taste is everything.”","Reggie let out a slow breath, a part of him felt amused by the absurdity of it all. “So you’re telling me the most beloved whimsical dream in recent memory was quietly erased, not by authoritarian censors, nor by sinister elites, but because Viviana St. Fleur found it... distasteful?”","Sneak Dueler nodded enthusiastically, mask slipping slightly askew. “Yes. Exactly! Now do you see why I need your help? Someone has to confront taste itself. Someone has to bring back genuine whimsy.”","Reggie straightened, a glimmer of genuine excitement lighting his tired eyes for the first time in years.","“Well,” he said, tightening his coat against the chill. “I suppose it’s time to commit an act of truly appalling bad taste.”","Reggie stared blankly at the velvet-masked Sneak Dueler who had just revealed his master plan.","“So your plan,” he repeated slowly, “is for me, a man who hasn’t had anything but carefully curated dreams in a decade, to dream something whimsical, silly, and ridiculous enough to catch the attention of Viviana St. Fleur herself, and then somehow… trap her in the act of stealing it?”","Sneak Dueler concurred. “It’s brilliant in its simplicity.”","Reggie sighed. “There’s just one small detail. I don’t exactly remember how to dream something whimsical.”","Sneak Dueler chuckled indulgently, reached into the folds of his coat and withdrew a crumpled pamphlet. “I suspected as much. Society’s forgotten the fundamentals, so allow me to reintroduce you to something absolutely essential.” He unfolded the pamphlet ceremoniously, presenting it to Reggie with a flourish.","“The Three Rules of Whimsy,” he declared.","Reggie squinted skeptically at the pamphlet, which was decorated with crudely drawn stick figures, floating donuts, and cats in bow ties.","“Rule one,” Sneak Dueler began solemnly, “ Embrace Nonsense . Whimsy isn’t logical. It doesn’t explain itself. It must delightfully confuse. The weirder, the better. If you find yourself wondering ‘but why?’ you’re already on the right track.”","“Rule two,” he continued, voice rising disconcertingly, “ No Status Allowed . Whimsy cares nothing for your prestige, dignity, or social ranking. Rubber chickens don’t have capital. Dancing potatoes hold no titles. Status is whimsy’s mortal enemy.”","Reggie nodded slowly, despite himself. He found he rather liked the idea of dancing potatoes.","“And rule three—perhaps most important of all,” Sneak Dueler said, lowering his voice to a reverent whisper. “ Delight is Mandatory . The goal of whimsy isn’t to impress or convince. It is pure, meaningless joy. Whimsy without delight is like a parade without rubber chickens: technically possible, but why would you?”","Reggie felt an unfamiliar urge to giggle rise from his diaphragm. He quickly suppressed it. “Alright,” he said cautiously, “but how do we ensure Viviana takes the bait?”","Sneak Dueler grinned beneath his velvet mask. “We upload your silly dream openly to the Mesh under your official title. A high-ranking dream curator breaking the seriousness protocol will set off every tasteful censor alarm in Viviana’s domain. She won’t be able to resist.”","“And how exactly do we catch her stealing it?”","Sneak Dueler’s grin widened further. “I have contacts. Let’s just say the Dream Mesh leaves footprints even the most elegant curator can’t hide. We’ll trace her actions directly, proving once and for all that whimsy didn’t vanish, it was stolen.","Reggie took a deep breath, a thousand possible objections forming and dissolving all at once. Finally, he shrugged, a reckless gleam in his eyes.","“Well, why not? After years of sanitized dreams, perhaps it’s finally time for society to wake up laughing.”","Sneak Dueler patted Reggie warmly on the shoulder, clearly thrilled. “Excellent! Now then, let’s find a place for you to nap. We have chickens to dream, potatoes to choreograph, and tastefulness to corrupt.”","It began, as most truly important events do, with a training montage.","Sneak Dueler, in full velvet-masked glory, paced in front of a sprawling chalkboard with diagrams labeled “Chicken Density,” “Absurdity Index,” and “Spontaneous Ballet Probability.” He vigorously gestured as Reggie scribbled notes, practiced bewildered shrugs, and occasionally attempted forced giggles. They spent afternoons watching vintage clips of geese in waistcoats, listened to records of nonsensical poems, and debated the comedic value of banana peels versus custard pies.","At first, Reggie’s attempts were embarrassing, clumsy messes. He dreamed of neatly arranged dancing potatoes with serious expressions, penguins politely reading aloud banking regulations, and a large snail patiently explaining tax codes.","Sneak Dueler shook his head mournfully at each result. “Too serious, Reggie. Forget sense! Less coherence, more chaos!”","Gradually, however, something shifted. Reggie’s dreams grew chaotic. He dreamed chickens in tiny bowler hats juggling smaller chickens, frogs organizing conferences about leap-year conspiracies, and rivers of multicolored gelatin filled with earnest, operatic marlins.

The second installment in a new anthology series from Spencer Nitkey. Missed part one? Read it here .","Sylvo always wanted to play this game when we were dating. He called it “If I was,” and I absolutely loathed it. “Ki,”, he’d ask, “would you love me if I was [insert inane suggestion here]?” I think the genesis of the game was some old meme about asking your partner “Would you still love me if I was a worm?” Which, OK, I could see the cloying charm, but Sylvo would ask these breathless, exhausting versions: “Would you still love me if I lost all power of speech and movement and had to communicate by blinking in Morse code?” “Would you still love me if the overlays declared me verboten and you only saw a blurry, muffled shape in my place?” etcetera.","He liked asking the questions, took some kind of sick pleasure in forcing me to affirm my love for him in increasingly unhinged scenarios. But he liked it even better when he would cajole me into asking one myself. The moment I finished, he’d smile all big and stupid and shout “Of course!” before launching himself at me with puckered lips.","In truth, I don’t know if I ever did love him. Like, at all. Let alone enough to love him through some heinous transformation or whatever. We started dating because he was handsome, and his attention was intoxicating at first. Big, liquid brown eyes that transformed into headlights when our gazes first met across the bar. Whatever his overlay settings were, I got the sense that he would blur the whole world out just to focus on me if they would let him, which of course they wouldn’t.","This was nice for a while, but it became kind of like eating poprocks for every meal. The big problem was that he was one of those dudes who really liked being in love . It was all he ever talked about: how compatible we were, how beautiful I was, how many adventures we’d have (mind you, he never actually planned any adventures, just kind of hazily dreamed about them having happened). He had the protocols of courting down pat. But the actual relationship? The part where you have to negotiate and attenuate and learn another person’s messy intricacies and develop a personal language only the two of you share? Totally useless there.","We broke up. Well, fine, I broke up with him. We were sitting on dewy lawn grass watching a drone light show in Chitram Row. The rowhomes turned the large screens affixed to their sides, and usually saved for advertisements, into mirror-mode reflections of the lights bursting and swirling above. He tried to hold my hand, a face in the sky turned into a school of fish that dove toward the river, and I couldn’t take it anymore.","It took him a few minutes to accept that I wasn’t joking. Like the concept that I would want our sad, saccharine attempt at a partnership to end was truly worldshifting for him. I thought he was going to cry when it finally sank in, but I watched this curious, steelly look pass across, then settle on his face like metal cooling.","“This is a chance to win you back,” he said. “A test.”","And look, I gotta hand it to the guy, if it had have been a test, he’d definitely be passing. My dining room table displayed a gradient of roses, from dark brown wilt to vibrant fresh reds. He once sent 100 in a single day.","(OK, fine. The other reason we lasted as long as we did is that he’s loaded – I’m talking real roses here, not bundles of metal sticks programmed to bloom in the overlays only.)","He stopped sending them to my work after the fifth bouquet that week got me called into HR, but they were still showing up at my apartment door every day. That’s not all, either. I was getting six “bespoke” AI songs about our love and relationship sent to my overlay audio request queue a day, dozens of these gauche renderings of me from videos he took with his implant while we were dating. He stopped me in the grocery store with a new overlay avatar projected over his body, like the problem was aesthetic and not emotional suffocation. I started looking over my shoulders on the city sidewalks in case he came barreling towards me with doughy love in his eyes and some cockamamy gift in his arms.","He was everywhere: popping up behind me in shop lines, swinging in on subway rail handles with an envelope between his teeth, and singing auto-tuned ballads as I ran from him through the streets. The overlays didn’t let you erase someone from your vision, but I wished they would let you erase yourself from others.","I know. We’d entered, decidedly, stalking territory. Trust me, I knew the statistics about where that leads, but evidently he was still seeing me, which meant the Zoothesia Protocols weren’t predicting he’d harm me. Presence must preserve , as the slogan goes.","After he surprised me in my apartment stairwell with a bottle of champagne. I visited a friend, Cressida, who worked on the hardware side of the overlays. She explained that if he was seeing me, the risk of physical injury of any kind was infinitesimal.","“The models are super high fidelity,” she explained. “The latest update brought incident rates down to less than 0.0001 per hundred thousand.”","“Ok, but is there no consideration for, like, psychic injury?” I asked.","“Only if it links to real, probable harm,” she said, I think, quoting the employee manual at that point.","“ Protocols for the People , my ass,” I said.","“Have you tried making him hate you so much that you do disappear?” she asked, chuckling as I was halfway out the door.","She was joking, but the spread of charcuterie and sweating, chocolate-covered fruit that was waiting for me at my apartment door made the prospect of foulmaxing my way out of his life too tempting a possibility to ignore.","I read up on it some. The technical term was phobisculpting, and it was mostly hippies and criminals who engaged. I liked the mouthfeel of foulmaxing better. I was ready to be foul. Truthfully, jumping into bodymodding felt exciting in a way I hadn’t expected. I spent a weekend trying to find someone seedy but approachable. Some forums said there was a dealer in Kaylan Grove, and I knew half the recent-grad hires I worked with lived there, so if they were selling to yuppies, they were probably pretty approachable.","I wandered around until I saw a guy sliding baggies to nervous suits and made my approach. His name was Oren, and he was nice, like almost too nice, for a dealer. That was fine with me. He gave me the name and coordinates of a sculptor and told me to meet her at 11 the next morning. The coordinates seemed like they were in a populous enough place, so I made my way there, only a regular amount of nervous, after literally sprinting through the city streets so Sylvo couldn’t give me a present he was waiting across the street from my apartment to deliver. His begging eyes were starting to upset me, like viscerally, and I couldn’t wait to disappear from his life.","We met in a parking lot outfront of a VR studio. A woman named Agra, with gemstones embedded in the skin of her left arm, rendering it useless, was waiting for me. They shimmered in the noonday overlay sun and seemed, at times, to glitch in and out of view.","“You trying to disappear?” she said, pulling a tablet out and taking a picture of my face without asking.","“Just lose one guy,” I said.","“Bespoke. Let me guess. Love gone wrong?”","As if on cue, an AI-generated song that started with ‘You’re the Ki to my heart, and I’m falling apart without you,” started blaring in my overlay until I blinked it mute.","“So what’re you thinking?” she asked.","“I thought that was your job,” I said.","“I mean, I can give you some basics, but if you’re trying to put off one person, you’d know what upsets them more than me.”","She had a good point. I thought about it a bit and realized that part of the problem with his whole romancing shtick was that I hadn’t ever really gotten to know him. He was always asking about me, obsessing over me, which, again, felt great at first, but there was a hollowness to the whole thing. It was always going to sink back in on itself like a poorly constructed skyscraper.","“It’s not just that he has to be repulsed by you. That’s what people get wrong about foulmaxing. It’s about a particular sub-type of disgust that triggers a fight response. Flight, freeze, faun, none of that’s gonna work for you.”","“Faun’s the whole problem… He’s scared of spiders,” I hazarded. “Like he’d see one and a second later he’d be throwing an improvised projectile at it.”","She paused, shot me a that’s what you got? look, and nodded.","I couldn’t stop looking at my new face in the bathroom mirror.","It was captivating, in a weird way. Eight black eyes blinking back at me. Sure, only two were functional, but the spectacle was startling. I’d grown all kinds of thick setae hairs across my arms that rose and fell with the goosebumps across my skin.","If Sylvo was scared of spiders, this ought to do it. Right?","I didn’t waste time. I had a few days off work and, in an ideal world, I’d sear this image of myself into him, trigger a “squish now” response that would turn the love in his heart over like spoiled milk, and then be free to undo all this.","I wanted to surprise him, figuring that would trigger the maximal fear response. It was a bit of a challenge, knowing he was also looking for me at, apparently, all hours of the day. I pulled up his socials, had my overlays project a little “frequently visited” flow over the city, like one of those spaghetti maps that show shipping routes, and started my own hunt.","I began with his food places, figuring he’d have to stop to stay sated even while hunting me. I tried all his most-frequented restaurants. I had to give the guy credit: he had exquisite taste. Every one was a reasonably-priced gem, great spots that never made the aggregator lists. Good taste is, unfortunately, hot. It occurred to me that if he’d been better able to share himself with me none of this would have been necessary.","I followed the thickest streams until I found him eating dinner at the Gaesous Giant, a high-end place where each table is cocooned in a glass sphere. Simple meats are served, and flavor pairings come via scented gas, piped in. He was sitting across from a gray-haired man and they were both picking around the last fatty dregs of their respective sirloins. It was perfect. He was contained, head down, in a prime position for a scare.","I thought about opening the door and just walking into their dome, but I wanted a single, shocking moment. I flung myself at the glass, smashing my body against it, pressing my many-eyed visage onto it, and roared. I spread my arms so their hairs would catch the light. Inside, he screamed.","I smiled. The chelicerae and fangs of my mouth moved with my cheeks. His eyes looked over me, and there was, I’m not afraid to admit, a rush of pleasure, hot and static, that overcame me when I saw his skin pale, nausea crest in his eyes, the horror dawn. I smeared myself toward him, sweat smudging the sphere.","I waited for him to run, to swing, to respond. He rose, excused himself, and left the sphere.","“Still love you. Have I finally passed?” He wiped sweat from his forehead. His eyes darted from the ground to me, then down again. He was scared and hiding it poorly, but it apparently didn’t matter. I wasn’t hideous enough, I thought.","I grabbed his face and made him look at my disfigured form.","That same, steely expression settled across him, and he didn’t look away.","Back in Agra’s gem-studded studio, I was ignoring the recently-added jewels which now fully obscured her shoulder, explaining to her that the first round hadn’t gone well and I needed to be re-remade. This time, though, I was better prepared. I had ideas.","I’d spent the intervening week calling in sick to work, being asked if I needed to consider a leave of absence, demuring, and – most importantly – stalking my stalker. The spider had been too obvious. I needed something deeper, something primal. This mostly involved me tracking down every minute detail of his life that had been recorded on the web. Cressida hooked me up with someone who worked in the algo department of Zoothesia, and he made me a little data-scraping bot for me that trawled everywhere for him.","I was, despite myself, often charmed by the man who fuzzily began to appear through this data. He wrote a lot. Insisted on writing reviews for public spaces so that people’s overlays would, occasionally, show him rating the grass in Nayanaport Gardens 3 out of 5 “under watered, over nitrogenated;” or a climbing gym 5 out of 5 “according to toddler-monkey-bar-expert Jonathan.” When he wasn’t too invested in squeezing the life out of something, his attention was kind, curious, and, in the physical sense, enlightening. If the man who wrote these reviews was ever capable of loving me in the same, gentle way that he loved the 5 out of 5 airtram waiting bench outside the abandoned factory in Shraville, “best place to eat a sandwich in the city,” we might have stood a chance.","This moment of sympathy was ended by a knock on my apartment door. I’d been distracted, so I opened it without really thinking, and there he was, with a terrarium between his outstretched arms, crawling with spiders.","“I’ve been training,” he said. “Look!” He reached his entire arm into the tank and let one skitter across his hand. He winced but didn’t panic. I slammed the door and locked it.","“I won’t give up!” he shouted through the drywall, while I turned my overlay volume up as high as I could to try to drown out his voice.","I think he left around the time I stumbled across a trove of information. An old poetry blog of his – the usage of the word “poetry” here being generous, to say the least – where his efforts oscillated between verses addressed to “a lover he hadn’t met yet” (guess that proclivity manifested early) and a series of insults directed at his father. The first few I read were bog-standard, “I hate you, Dad” teenage angst-type stuff, but the more I read, the clearer the picture of his father grew. Fidelity did the man no favors. Even with several grains of silicate, Sylvo’s capacity for love, overbearing as it was, felt like a miracle. He’d broken a cycle of violence few could.","A picture of him, shirtless, with a tarantula legging across his hairy chest appeared in my messaging channel, and the sympathy vanished. I needed to get away from him, forever.","So here I was, with Agra again, her triple-checking whether this was really what I wanted.","I gave her the money and she didn’t ask any more questions.","“Hope it works,” she said.","I was no longer arachnid. I was patriarchal. His father’s face stared back at me from the mirror. My oceli replaced with a perpetual five o’clock shadow. My hairy arms replaced with, well, a different kind of hair. I looked just like him.","I didn’t go searching for him this time. I let him come to me. Looking like this awful man, I felt a kind of despondency building inside me. I didn’t like being someone awful. For the first time, I was really hoping he’d stop by, to get this all over with.","After four days, he managed to talk his way into my apartment complex again. Knocking came next. I waited. I’d been overeager last time, hadn’t taken the time necessary to build the scene up to maximize a response. This time, I wouldn’t make that mistake.","“Open,” I croaked, as close to my old voice as I could muster. The dimmed lights in the apartment welcomed him, but I was in the bedroom, which beckoned with a cracked door. I heard his footsteps and heavy breathing as he made his way towards me. I lay waiting, more like a predator than I had been as a spider.","When he walked through the door, I shrugged a silk robe off my shoulders and turned to face him.","I thought his heart might have stopped right then. He paled as if exsanguinated and stumbled toward me. I stepped backward, instinctively, as he reached. Then he vomited all over the hardwood.","I raised my deepened voice. My fingers ran across his cheek.","“Do you still want me, Sylvo?”","He steadied himself by grabbing the edge of my bed and rose to meet my eyes.","“There is nothing that could make me hate you, love, surely you know that by now. Not when you love me enough to force me to move past my trauma.”","“I can’t promise today, or even tomorrow, but I will love you like this, Ki. I will make myself whole and we can be together and –”","I sprinted out of my own apartment. Despair raged like an oil fire through me, and I didn’t stop running until my legs gave out. I just wanted him gone. I’d do anything to free myself from him.","“What in the ever-loving algo, Ki? You look like a kitbashed bio textbook. What happened?” Clarissa wasn’t horrified, but she was disgusted, and, more importantly, she was right.","After his father failed, I went hard down the foulmaxing pipeline. One of my arms was riddled with pods, like a lotus, bent on triggering his trypophobia. My midsection, made translucent with a graymarket edidermal polymer integration, showed, in real time, the excrement accumulating in my stomach. Eight legs, only two functional, spread beneath me. His father’s face peered out from mine. I was a collage of his fears, and he still saw me. Relentlessly, he saw me.","I was invisible to half the city now, maybe more, and found the freedom of translucence both isolating and enchanting. Watching someone look straight through me, the way they would a delivery drone or traffic cone, I found myself understanding, a little, the voyeuristic pleasure Sylvo might be feeling while he stalked me. I’d taken my boss up on the LOA suggestion and was, for three months, free to wander the city, a collage of my stalker’s worst fears, absent from almost everyone’s vision except his.","And Clarissa. You never know who your real friends are until you foulmax, I guess.","“I have a question,” she hazarded. It wasn’t like her to be hesitant.","“Why not make him disappear from you? I mean, you clearly loathe the guy. How hard would it be to spin your wheels a little until the Zoo thinks you’re a threat to him?”","“Isn’t it pretty hard, like by design, to do that? The whole genesis was like every life is worth seeing .”","She just looked me up and down a few times with her lips curled.","She sighed, shut her office door, and sat back down.","“I’m going to make this simple. The Zoo’s algo is like, half-sentient at this point, it’s so complicated, but it really boils down to two vectors: power and desire. People only think about the second one. Well, they usually call it disgust, but the Zoo isn’t modelling for disgust as such, it’s using disgust as a proxy for desire to harm. Point being, people think it’s all about that first half. Desire, disgust, whatever you want to call it. When it’s deciding whether or not you’re a threat, though, the other thing it’s assessing is power, or your ability to harm the thing you hate. I’m not supposed to say this, but that’s why there’s a slight gender imbalance when you analyze men disappearing from women vs. women disappearing from men. Power. You get it?”","“I was trying to be nice. I think you would break your hand if you punched 80% of the population. Have you ever even slapped someone before? The Zoo knows you. It knows you’re harmless. I mean, just look at you now. You’re willing to Frankenstein yourself into this, this thing, before the thought of just beating the shit out of him ever even crossed your mind.”","I left Clarissa’s office still stinging from the truth of it. The thought of actually hurting Sylvo hadn’t ever crossed my mind. On the street outside, I caught myself in the reflection of a skyscraper’s towering glass window. I jolted. I thought, for a second, I might disappear from my own vision. I hated what I saw that much. Then I laughed, and even then I hated myself more than I hated the person who’d driven me to this. My laughter crested and my insides shook, in full view, as I did. Tears followed after. I sat on the street corner sobbing as people silently stepped around me. I wept until I felt it – that same steel I’d watched harden over Sylvo during our breakup and after each successive attempt to terrify him into hating me. I wouldn’t become unlovable. I’d become dangerous.","Six months of twice-daily combat training. Before and after work; a dozen sessions with Agra undoing most of what I’d done as best she could; more than 300 hours throwing knives, axes, and punches; just as much time spent in gyms lifting and running; all the while dodging the ever-present advances of Sylvo.","It wasn’t enough to become dangerous; it turned out. The hardest part for me was the desire. Every day I forced myself to imagine driving my fist into Sylvo’s face. The first month, I’d feel guilty every time. I’d oscillate between my imagination and memories of his intrusions in my once peaceful life. Eventually, I could unflinchingly imagine hurting Sylvo. Still that wasn’t enough.","As a kid, I was one of the people who avoided the screaming bugs, rather than crush more of them before the update rolled out. So I took it step by step, scaffold by scaffold. I held a knife tight in my hands and slid it into raw meat while I kept my eyes shut imagining it was Sylvo’s stomach. Over and over again, I rehearsed hurting, then killing him. It was hard, horrible work, but slowly I habituated myself to violence.","It was my defensive posture, I decided. Despite my growing capacity for violence, I hadn’t demonstrated a willingness to use it. For whatI hoped was the last time, I turned Sylvo’s stalking back on him. I would hunt him.","I used the same overlay maps to trace his known routes. None of my earlier admiration returned to distract me. I was hardened, now. I let him see me across the street from his favorite bespoke weather overlay designer. He came out smiling, and I let him follow me across the street before dipping into an alley.","I don’t see Sylvo anymore. I woke up in the alley a while later and, if he was still there, he was hidden from me. I wondered if, in order to protect him from me, the Zoothesia Protocols also, finally, removed me from his vision. I wonder, now, whether an awkwardly parked car or portapotty is Sylvo in disguise.","My life has returned to a kind of normal, though, I will confess, that the world seems slightly emptier than it was before my attempted murder. I could be imagining it, but I feel like I see fewer people on the street than I used to. My friends, family, co-workers are all still there, but the noise and bustle of the city itself seems to have diminished. I wonder if my violence, the act I took changed more than just my relationship with Sylvo. Does the Zoo hide others from me now? I don’t know. The flower deliveries have ceased. My peaceful Sunday coffees outside on a street corner are back. I just can’t help but feel like discovering my capacity for violence was a more extreme change than any of the foulmaxing ever was, and that the Zoo, through its rigid rules and opaque algorithm, changed me more than I ever changed myself.","In this issue: A world where augmented reality overlays are widespread, offering their users beautiful facades – day, after day, after day… until even the most beautiful sights seem tame and lifeless.

Looking up, Ping freezes, her back straightening: a view she’s revisited often in her dreams, but not seen in reality for decades. Her heartbeat crashing in her ears, Ping sees the refracted purple glow of a flickering neon sign reflected on the rainslicked, potholed street.","Lin Store 47 – 林家商店47號 – ร้านยามาลิน สาขา ๔๗","Ama had renamed it years ago, after the chain that originally owned it, Lucky Star, went under during the Second Credit Collapse. She kept the store number for familiarity’s sake, although Store 46 and Store 48 had surely long since disappeared. The only remnants of the old corporate structure were its long-deprecated management system, which Ping recalled for its colorful personality.","Ping signals the team to continue checking for holdouts and strides across the field towards the store, her pulse quickening with each step.","Through the smeared glass, Ping eyes shelves cluttered with emergency protein gel sticks, family-sized electrolyte bricks, colorful stimpatch narcotic strips, and dusty solar kettles. Inside, several Pre-AMOC residents calmly go about their business; a couple argues over whose turn it is to choose the flavor of electrolyte brick they’re buying this week before settling on Calamansi Lime, while a woman loads chives and ginger into her battered old Piaggio Gita cargo bot. A steady soundtrack of frantic chirps and wailing sirens provide background ambiance, as customers’ comms devices plead with them to evacuate.","Presiding serenely over it all from her perch behind the scuffed duracrete counter, now a pockmarked terrazzo of patches of thermobamboo laminate after years of repairs, sits Ama. The smell of her sobacha mixes with the plastic tang of damp stimpatches and the faint mustiness of ionized refrigerant, an aroma cocktail that instantly transports Ping back to long-ago rainy afternoons.","Ama looks up, quietly regarding Ping.","Suddenly, from behind Ping, a voice: “Dearie, where are the State Ration Packs you folks always hand out?” Ping turns. A gnarled old man regards her quizzically from behind arms piled high with neon green, Pandan-flavored electrolyte bricks. “I want those ginger-flavored energy biscuits they always put in there… y’know, the chewy ones!”","“Ginger biscuits?! How can you possibly be thinking about cookies in a time like this?!” Ping replies indignantly. “My team is here to help safely evacuate you all! This place is going to be underwater!”","Another elder, juggling a battery of onions, nudges her. “Hey, Ms. Helpful, are you just going to stand there and let an old lady be crushed to death beneath her vegetables, or are you going to help carry all this?”","Huffily, Ping grabs the onions and follows the woman toward the door. Crossing the threshold, a chipper voice calls out, instantly transporting Ping back over twenty years into the past:","Customer Lanna Heng: Lucky Star loyalty program member 27 years, auto-discount applied… conventional discount system overridden, Lin Store Elite Cucumber-level loyalty tier program member 227 years, discount applied; extreme weather event discount, applied; friends and family discount, applied; total bill of three credits, have a wonderful day!","As Ping steps back inside, Ama laughs gently, saying, “Don’t mind Lanna, she just wants what she wants.”","Putting a hundred burning questions aside, Ping leans against the counter, feeling the deep grooves worn by decades of scrubbing. “Grandma, please tell me you’re going to evacuate.”","Ama quietly looks at Ping with her trademark gaze, equal parts sharp and warm, much like the first few seconds after applying a stimpatch. Ping opens her mouth again, then hesitates. Ama reaches across the counter and squeezes her hand.","“Where would I go, child? Your mother still won’t talk to me, and I will not be put into some climate adaptation center where I’m treated like cattle. This store is my home. It needs me. These people need me.”","Ping feels her face flush, sensing everything she wants to say boiling beneath the surface.","A shrill comms alert splits the air, followed by the team engineer’s voice struggling to conceal anxiety: “Ping, uh, listen, we’ve got a critical blockage on infra-subgrid 14. The drainage sensors... they’re stuck in this weird feedback loop, and I can’t patch in to fix it remotely… I think we need an on-site override.”","With a heavy sigh, Ping turns to jog out the door into the intensifying downpour.","That night, Ping lays in her bunk, listening to the static roar of the rain, her face illuminated by the glow of her comm as her husband’s face flickers into focus. Bleary-eyed, he struggles to hold their squirming daughter on his lap.","“She’s still awake?” Ping asks.","“Refused to sleep, kept saying ‘mama’, so I thought better of arguing with her.”","Ping smiles through her fatigue as her daughter waves madly before clambering off of her husband’s lap and crawling away from the viewpane. Her Beaing, a glowing green tortoise, follows her, supervising.","“My dear, you look positively deep-fried...” his voice tinged with concern.","“Long day. Look, you won’t believe this, but I found Ama. She’s alive. Still running the store like it’s… like a time warp. Nothing’s changed.”","“Whoa. After all this time…”","“Yeah, right?! She didn’t even flinch when I walked in! I always imagined all the things I’d tell her if I saw her again, all the things I’d ask, but now, I just felt... sadness? Anger? Regret?”","“Did you ask her why she cut ties?”","“No way – that’s way too much right now... I just want her to evacuate safely, this whole area is sinking.”","“Completely refused. She says her customers, a bunch of Pre-AMOC old-timers like her, need her. She’s patched the store’s outdated systems so many times, and filled it with so much of her own personality and preferences for all her friends… I think she’s just too attached to it all.”","“To be fair, she’s probably poured a lot more of herself into that store than we’ll ever know.”","“Look, love. If she really won’t evacuate… what about getting her to upload herself into your Airloom?”","Ping’s comm illuminates the tears she struggles to hold back.","“Is that really the only option?”","“Maybe. But if she won’t leave, how else will our daughter ever know her? We never get all the time we want with our loved ones, but an Airloom is better than nothing, right? And you keep saying the Airloom is thin on your side.”","“It is! Yours is a cathedral. Mine’s… well, basically a falling-down convenience store.” She laughs bitterly.","“Love, this isn’t about winning some ancestral arms race.”","“Isn’t it?! You’ve seen what our friends’ kids can do when they can converse with full-spectrum Airlooms spanning generations! I just want that same thing for her...”","Ping’s husband rubs his temples and shuts his eyes, “I want that too! But if she won’t leave… what else can you do? Can I come and force her?”","“No, no, that’d only make things worse… if you think I’m stubborn, well, you wouldn’t believe how stubborn Ama can be. Probably why she and Mom don’t speak anymore. You should see this store, she’s made it to be like the inside of her own head.”","“I get it… then the Airloom is our best option, right?”","Ping closes her eyes and grimaces.","“I know, it’s just that… I spent so long feeling angry at her. And now that she’s suddenly back here, I don’t know what to say. ‘Hey, glad to know you’re alive. Can you please upload all your memories into this thing?’ What if she just wants to… disappear?”","Ping hesitates for a moment before stepping over the threshold, out of the rain and back into her namesake store.","A warm chime, followed by a staticky voice, crackles:","Customer Ping Lin: Lin Store Hyper-elite Durian-level loyalty tier program member 1,348 years, welcome! Hyper-elite status loyalty discount applied!","Ping’s eyes narrow. “This old store OS was supposed to be decommissioned decades ago, Ama… this system isn’t even on the certified registry anymore! If it glitches during the flood…”","Ama rolls her eyes like an exasperated teenager. “I know every fuse and wire in this place. I’ve patched its code more times than I can count. Don’t worry so much!”","As if on cue, the store chime sounds:","Drought-Season Discount now active. Hydration bricks 16% off if purchased with an umbrella!","Ama smiles faintly. “Well, it usually works well enough.”","“Ama, won’t you please reconsider and leave with us? The team has to move on to the next evacuation site in a few hours, but there’s still time to get a space on the vessel that’s leaving. Please?”","Ama clucks her tongue. “Ping, I can’t do that. I’m the only one who can keep this store running. I’d be betraying those who remain here, people who I’ve known for decades, people who…”","“You have more loyalty to these people and this falling-apart store than to your own family?! You don’t care if your great-granddaughter never knows you?!”","Ama casts her gaze downwards, considering the worn countertop.","Ping fumbles in her satchel, and pulls out a small, black, polished disc, etched with circuits. She slides it across the grooved countertop surface towards Ama.","“This is an Extensible Airloom Token. If you truly refuse to leave, then won’t you at least add your memories to our family’s Airloom? Your great-granddaughter deserves the chance to know you. Even if you don’t care whether you know her.”","Ama regards the token warily. “What is there to know? I’m just an old woman who runs a falling-apart convenience store, right?”","Ping sighs exasperatedly, leaning against the counter. “Ama, spare me the theatrics. You know, you were the one who taught me to love people. To feed them. To care. You taught me kindness.”","A gust of wind rips a turbine loose from the store’s roof. It clatters to the sidewalk.","“Ah, my dear, it’s not that simple. Why do you think I patched this store’s inventory systems in the first place? This store… it knows about the data I had to spoof after I found out your grandfather had been stealing the store’s lottery tickets… it knows about the milk powder that I had to alter the expiration dates on so it would let me discard them, so that I could feed it to your mother when she had just been born and we had no money for such things…”","Ping gazes across the counter, trying to read the wrinkles in Ama’s face like the lines on an inscrutable map. “Ama, come on! I know you did the very same things for your customers! You gave credit to the families that couldn’t afford food, just like you’d give free candies to students on the last day of school!”","Ama sighed, shaking her head. “That’s why I can’t leave, my dear. No other surviving stores in this place have any conscience. Prices are algo-dictated. There’s nowhere else that recognizes them not just what they can pay, but what they’re going through. There’s only me. What other store would give discounts to people buying emergency supplies during this storm? Where is the Adaptation Force for these people?”","“Ama, these people don’t need discounts , they need to escape ! You need to get out of here! This place is going to be underwater! It isn’t going to exist anymore!”","Ama’s back straightens, eyes sparkling ferociously. “As long as they are here, then I’m here. Even after the floodwaters come and go, this place will still exist. The corporate algorithms and Adaptation Force teams may not care if this community survives, but I do.”","Ping clenched her jaw. “And what happens if you don’t survive? What good is a principled stand if you and this store are washed away?!”","Ama leans on the counter, leveling her gaze at Ping. “Then I disappear. You think the Airloom would understand this store, and how it and I work together? You’ve always wanted everything to be fair and correct, Ping. I know. You inherited that from me. But the world rarely lets you be both right and kind. This store… it showed me how it’s one thing to break the rules to help yourself, but another to break them for the ones you love.”","Ama reaches out, absentmindedly spinning the token like the coin of an ancient realm. It whirs drunkenly over the patterns and grooves of the counter before catching an edge, and rolling to a stop in front of Ping. “It’s not that I’m afraid, Ping. It’s that I don’t want to be remembered as a tidy file of nice sayings. I want to be remembered in the way that this store, this community, remembers me.”","As if on cue, the store’s chime sparks back to life:","Rain event category updated to: Beyond Severe. Spicy Mango Jerky Flash Sale activated! Buy two, get two free! For residents with barometric sensitivity, antihistamine bundles are now nine credits with ration point matching enabled. Stay dry out there!","Ping stared at her grandmother, unsure whether to laugh or cry.","The rain lashes harder, ten thousand fingers drumming anxiously on the store’s battered roof.","“... but if that thing can hold all of this,” she said softly, gesturing around the store, “the full story… if it can remember me inside of the store, and not apart from it… then yes. I would do it. But it has to hold everything.”","Ping nodded, throat tight. “I’ll try my best to keep it all intact. I promise. Although, full disclosure, I have no idea what happens when you try to upload… an entire store…”","They’re interrupted by a shrill alarm over the store speakers:","Warning: Water ingress level critical. Emergency systems nearing operational threshold. Final backup containment protocols recommended. Engage now?","Ama gives a small nod, “It would seem it’s apt time to find out.” Looking up, Ama barks, “LS-OS, stand by to engage final backup containment protocols.” Ping hurriedly speaks a few code-incantations while waving her hand over the token, then instructs Ama to place her hand upon it.","Then gradually, a quiet humming fills the room, forming a counterpoint bassline to the rain’s frantic drumming. The OS crackles through static:","Initializing memory uptake. Cross-system integration sequence engaged. Please do not remove object during sync. Stay safe out there, everyone!","The humming bassline intensifies as the store’s lights begin rhythmically dimming and brightening, long-forgotten protocols being awoken. Then, a new tone. Not quite warning, not quite celebratory:","Sync anomaly detected. Context capacity inadequate, engaging override protocols to sync with auxiliary nodes recommended. Engage now?","Ama blinks. “Hmm, that’s a new one… I’m not even sure what that means. LS-OS, can you explain what…”","The new tone again, impatient this time.","Inadequate time. Engaging override protocols, mirror-syncing to Lucky Star mesh network and KnotLine v.3.7 protocols. Please do not remove object during sync. Enjoy discounts on high-protein tofu shakes for the next hour! Stay hydrated out there, everyone!","Ping’s comm device buzzes violently as an Airloom notification illuminates the screen:","ALERT: Node type mismatch detected – expected “Individual Memory Object,” received “Multi-sensor Retail Complex.” Proceed?

Other times, it was only Ama’s voice, disembodied but clear, offering unsolicited advice on electrolyte brick flavors or explaining how to reheat leftover dumplings.","Simultaneously, Ping began to hear reports of unexplainable events across the province’s snack kiosks and convenience stores. Grandparents purchasing heatwraps were thanked by name. Children buying spicy mango jerky were auto-credited with coupons for free second bags, each one reading, “just this once!” Across the tangled mesh of KnotLine protocols and deprecated Lucky Star store codebase residuals, Ama’s consciousness had scattered like light through a prism.","And sometimes, late at night, as rain pelted the windows, Ping would sit with her daughter and whisper stories about a stubborn old woman who ran a magical store that always looked out for you.","Zach Hyman is a Hong Kong–based design strategist and researcher who traces how people creatively hack and adapt objects, cities, and systems around them to make them kinder, legible, and more humane.

The book provides a fresh glimpse of how protocols have evolved and proliferated over time. While this summary will surely miss details and nuance of the original version, it’s been hand-edited to highlight many of the most relevant insights.","In the age of Louis XIV, protocol determined whether you would kiss the king’s hem or be thrown out the palace gates. A commemorative coin minted in 1661 shows the Sun King rising from his throne to greet kneeling petitioners, flanked by children, under the motto facilis ad principem aditus — “easy access to the prince”.","This image of accessibility was carefully curated. In reality, any audience with the monarch was choreographed by strict court protocol to solve the “access to the sovereign” problem. As citizenships ballooned in headcount under empire, rulers could not sustain the same rate of direct contact with constituents. Out of necessity, every gatekeeper, from minister to maid, fiercely regulated what impressions reached the ruler. Protocol, in other words, is a script of rules deciding who gets to do what , when , and how . It’s the hidden choreography behind diplomacy, bureaucracy, and even our digital networks today.","Fast forward to the 21st century, and we find protocols at the core of internet infrastructure — strange rules of cyberspace that steer how computers communicate. The concept of “protocol” has traveled a long way on its journey from royal courts to WiFi routers.","The German-language academic volume Das Protokoll (edited by Peter Plener, Niels Werber, and Burkhardt Wolf, 2023) maps this concept’s sweeping transformations. In 15 diverse essays, the book explores how protocols structure, regulate, and document interactions across diplomacy, administration, technology, literature, and religion.","Why focus on protocols? Because, the volume argues, they have long been the central medium by which loose human interactions are turned into binding order — writing down and prescribing what must (and must not) be done, filtering messy reality into an authoritative record. Ultimately, protocols ensure that something gets decided.","The book’s four thematic sections — Prozedere & Prozess (procedure & process), Mitschriften (minutes & transcripts), Techniken (techniques), and Schreibweisen (writing modes) — each spotlight a different arena where protocol operates. Together, they show the chameleon nature of the concept. From etiquettes of power to the algorithms of a networked society, protocols are the connective tissue of order. Let’s explore each in turn, to see how Das Protokoll illuminates the protocol’s journey across ages and fields.","What does it take to get an audience with a king? Or a hearing in government? This section explores protocols as the rituals and processes of decision-making. Co-editor Niels Werber opens with an essay titled Protokoll , bridging the gap between old-world diplomacy and the digital age. Werber revisits Schmitt’s “access to the powerful” problem by examining how diplomatic protocol in royal courts literally scripted who could appear before the monarch, when, and in what manner.","In one striking historical case, a Swiss delegation was denied access to the French king — not due to personal offense, but because diplomacy’s preferred medium was face-to-face interaction and the protocol wasn’t met. As communication media evolved (telegraph, telephone, email), the rules of access shifted: personal audience gave way to protocols of communication .","Werber’s chapter concludes by leaping into the present with a bold thesis: the Internet Protocol (IP) itself “re-adjusts the question of access” and establishes new digital hierarchies and centers of power. In other words, even the open internet has gatekeepers — just as palace officials once controlled entry to the throne room.","Diplomatic protocol in the classic sense also gets its due. Tobias Nanz’s essay Das diplomatische Protokoll recounts the evolution of diplomatic etiquette and ceremony. We learn how formal court protocols (like the Spanish Habsburgs’ elaborate Hofzeremoniell ) weren’t mere pomp — they were tools to manifest political order and rank.","Anthropologist Anna Weichselbraun then takes us “word for word” into the analysis of diplomatic verbatim transcripts as historical sources, showing how even the tiniest procedural phrasing in a treaty negotiation can become critical archival evidence. Through such studies, this section highlights protocols as both process and product: the meetings and negotiations themselves, and the written records that outlive them.","Interestingly, protocol can also become a site of contestation. Jonas Mirbeth’s contribution looks at West Berlin’s 1969 university reforms, specifically Protokoll und Protest in lectures by Klaus Heinrich. Here, we glimpse protocol colliding with politics: student protesters and a dissident professor challenging the official meeting minutes and procedures of an education reform — essentially fighting the system by arguing over its protocols.","And in a leap back to imperial times, Peter Becker’s essay Protokollbücher als Steuerung von Entscheidungsprozessen. Die Kabinettskanzlei und der Schreibtisch des Kaisers reveals how seemingly dry protocol books steered decision-making at the Emperor’s desk. In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, for example, cabinet meeting protocols and registers at the imperial chancellery weren’t passive records — they actively guided which issues reached the monarch and how decisions were formalized. Protocol, we see, is power: from grand diplomatic set-pieces to the minutiae of bureaucratic paperwork, it is the mechanism by which human authority is choreographed and decisions are inscribed.","If you’ve ever been the note-taker in a meeting, you know the power (and pain) of writing the official minutes. Mitschriften , the second thematic block, delves into protocols as written transcripts — the minutes that become an institution’s memory.","A running theme here is how these transcripts turn into tools of truth and accountability. As one chapter title puts it, protocols can be “für die aufmerksamen Zuhörer eine Pein, für die unaufmerksamen ein Schlafmittel” — “for the attentive listener a torment, for the inattentive a sleeping pill”. This wry quote (borrowed from a historical source) captures the paradox of bureaucratic minutes: painstakingly detailed records that are often painfully dull to read. Yet within that tedium lies authority.","Historian Therese Garstenauer’s essay examines disciplinary hearings of public servants in early 20th-century Austria, where protocol played a pivotal role in Wahrheitsfindung — finding the truth. Her findings are illuminating: “Das Protokoll schreibt institutionell produzierte Wahrheit fest” — the protocol writes down institutionally produced truth, guaranteed by formal procedures and by the presence of the stenographer as an eyewitness. In courts and administrative tribunals, nothing is considered real until it’s in the minutes. “Ein nichtprotokolliertes Verhör ist kein Verhör,” she notes — an interrogation not recorded in a protocol is not an interrogation. This echoes the old Latin maxim: quod non est in actis, non est in mundo — what’s not in the records is not in the world. Such is the power of the pen in bureaucracy. Garstenauer even shows how, in a 1920s case of a civil servant accused of insulting a court verdict, the painstaking compilation of protocols, witness statements, and even site inspections all served to manufacture an official truth upon which punishment could be decided. The protocol, in effect, was the truth-maker.","Other contributions in Mitschriften underscore this authority of the written record. Stephan Kurz uncovers a trove of ministerial council minutes in Cisleithanian, Austria (1848–1918 ) — administrative-political protocols that formed the backbone of governance in a multinational empire. In these records, one can trace how policies were debated and how the empire’s fate was charted on paper. Maren Lehmann’s intriguingly titled piece Die Eitelkeit der Organisation (The Vanity of the Organization) considers how protocols function as “Vor- und Mitschriften formaler Mitgliedschaft” – pre-records and transcripts of formal membership. In clubs, committees, or even states, to be included in the protocol is to be a member, and vice versa. Her sociological lens suggests that organizations “write themselves into existence” by keeping minutes of their meetings — a vain exercise perhaps, but crucial for defining who’s in and who’s out.","We also encounter a reflexive, critical note in this section. Thomas Eder’s Protocol Analysis. Materialien zu einer Kritik; oder Wo bleibt das richtige Protokoll? questions whether there can ever be a “right” or complete protocol, compiling materials for a critique of our obsession with record-keeping. And in a thought-provoking finale, Thomas Just bluntly declares “Das Protokoll gibt es nicht” — there is no such thing as the protocol. By this, he points to the idea that protocol is always plural and contextual. There is no single Platonic form of protocol , only protocols embedded in specific cultures and purposes. This resonates with the entire volume’s message: protocol is a shape-shifter. It can be meeting minutes, a treaty’s fine print, a ceremonial code, or a computer language. In every case, though, it materializes authority — turning spoken words and social interactions into enduring, actionable scripts.","Having examined the human side of protocols in meetings and diplomacy, Das Protokoll shifts gear — quite literally — to the technological dimension of protocols. The third section, Techniken (techniques), asks how protocols function as media and technical infrastructures. Here we move from the dusty archives to the world of code, algorithms, and information systems. Yet the continuity is striking: even in machines, protocols are about setting rules and order for interaction.","Sebastian Gießmann kicks off this section by delving into the history of something seemingly prosaic: the credit report. His essay Protokollieren und Formatieren explores the media history of credit reporting. In the 19th and 20th centuries, financial institutions developed standardized forms and ledgers — essentially protocols for personal data — to record individuals’ creditworthiness. The act of protokollieren (logging) and formatieren (formatting) in this context was a technique of trust: by following a set protocol (fill in these fields, use these codes), banks turned subjective judgments into objective-looking reports. Gießmann shows that even our financial lives have long been governed by protocols that decide who is “good for it” and who isn’t.","From ledgers we move to images. Media scholar Roland Meyer’s chapter, pointedly titled Everything that happens to a photo , examines analogue and digital protocols of image logistics. Consider how photographs today carry metadata (timestamps, camera settings, GPS coordinates) or how digital image files undergo standardized compression, transfer, and storage. Every step follows a protocol. Meyer’s essay suggests that every click of the camera and every upload leaves a trace in a larger protocol — a hidden itinerary of the image as it travels through databases and networks. The phrase “everything that happens to a photo” hints at a world where even creative or personal media are enmeshed in technical rules. In effect, our memories (in photos) are being administered by protocols of file formats and algorithms.","Perhaps the most futuristic (and ominous) example comes from Nina Franz’s contribution. Her essay Über das Protokoll hinaus (beyond the protocol) examines the quest for total control through algorithms in military and police contexts. She discusses the “phantasm of automation” — the fantasy that human decision-making (with all its messy contingency) could be rendered unnecessary by perfect technical protocols. Think of predictive policing systems or autonomous weapons: they aspire to protocols so complete and rigid that nothing is left to chance. Franz analyzes how realistic this vision is, and what it means when protocol-driven automation meets the unpredictable real world. The very title “beyond the protocol” is telling — it suggests trying to eliminate the unpredictable outside of protocol, an impulse as old as bureaucracy and as new as AI.","Finally, Anna Tuschling’s standout essay Offene Totalität, Internetprotokolle in der spätkapitalistischen Gesellschaft brings us squarely into the realm of the internet. Tuschling argues that to truly grasp the internet age, we must expand our notion of protocol. Technical protocols like TCP/IP — the internet protocol suite — do more than ensure an orderly exchange of data. They have become, she writes, the sine qua non of connectivity: without technical protocols, the linking of computers wouldn’t just be disorderly — it would be impossible. In other words, internet protocols aren’t just another step in the progression from court etiquette to phone rules; they radically widen the concept of protocol. These are rules that actively create the networked world.","Tuschling builds on media theorist Alexander Galloway’s famous idea that “protocol” is the new form of power in our era. Internet protocols hide in the background of our online lives, quietly integrating, regulating, and controlling the flow of information. They decide which devices can talk, how far messages reach, and where the bottlenecks are. In her analysis, internet protocols exhibit an “open totality”: they strive to include an ever-expanding multitude of nodes (people, computers, devices) in one network, but not by enforcing uniformity or centralization. Instead, they achieve a kind of all-encompassing connectivity — an ‘open integration’ of everyone, on a technical level, into a single web. This open-ended inclusion, paradoxically, is a form of totality: the internet tends toward engulfing the whole globe, not by a top-down plan, but by the bottom-up logic of its protocols. Such total connectivity brings its own power dynamics. Tuschling notes that while early internet enthusiasts saw decentralization as liberation, the reality is that protocols themselves wield power — just in a diffuse way. They set the conditions under which communication is possible, thereby indirectly shaping social possibilities.","In sum, the Techniken block paints a picture of protocol as infrastructure. Whether it’s a bank’s credit database, a camera’s software, or the Internet backbone, protocols form an invisible scaffold holding up modern life. They are the new bureaucracy — not of paper, but of code. And as with the old bureaucracy, we must ask: who designs these protocols? What values do they encode? The book doesn’t offer simple answers, but by placing technical protocols in historical context, it reminds us that even the newest technologies draw on an old desire: to bring order to chaos through rules and records.","In its final section, Das Protokoll turns to the realms of literature and religion, showing that protocols are not just bureaucratic tools but also cultural narratives and writing styles. Schreibweisen means modes of writing — and here the focus is on how the protocol format itself becomes a literary or spiritual form. These essays offer some of the most surprising connections, from Jesuit spiritual exercises to Kafka’s novels, underscoring that the impulse to document, list, and prescribe spans domains as lofty as faith and as lowly as paperwork.","We begin on a spiritual note. Andreas Bähr introduces us to a distinctly religious kind of protocol: the “Sünden-Protokoll” — the sin log. In Ignatius of Loyola’s 16th-century Exercitia Spiritualia (spiritual exercises), practitioners are instructed to keep meticulous charts of their sins and progress in overcoming them. Bähr’s essay Punkte und Linien (points and lines) lays out Ignatius’s guidelines for this sin-protocol. Imagine a penitent with a notebook, marking a point or a line for each lapse in virtue each day — literally a tally of the soul’s trespasses. This was a disciplined writing practice, a form of self-examination by record-keeping. Bähr compares this Jesuit practice with later Pietist and Puritan “Seelenprotokolle” (soul protocols or spiritual diaries), as well as with more secular 17th-century lists of calamities and atrocities (essentially sin registers in chronicles of war). By placing these side by side, the essay asks: what makes a protocol “religious”?","The answer seems to lie in their purpose and structure. These early modern religious protocols were “Verzeichnisse heilsrelevanter Geschehensabläufe” — lists of events relevant to salvation. They had a precise structure and spatial layout (columns, tables, tally marks) that reflected a belief: if you could faithfully record your moral life, you could understand and perhaps improve it. In the process, as Bähr notes, quantitative dimensions of the religious popped up — a kind of spiritual bookkeeping. The protocol format turned prayer into a ledger, repentance into a series of entries. This captivating look at Ignatius’s Schreibweise shows protocol in a surprising light: as a tool for self-governance and conscience in the quest for salvation.","Next, the volume pivots from the sacred to the downright infamous. Niels Penke tackles one of the most notorious “protocols” in history — Die Protokolle der Weisen von Zion (the protocols of the Elders of Zion ). This text, fabricated in the early 20th century, purports to be the secret minutes of a meeting of Jewish leaders plotting world domination. In reality, it was a malicious hoax — fiction presented as archival truth — that fueled anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for decades. Penke’s essay Fiktion, Archiv, Funktion unpacks how this forgery wielded power precisely by masquerading as a protocol. Its fictional narrative was cloaked in the form of meeting minutes, giving it an air of authenticity and bureaucratic authority (the logic being: “if it’s written like a protocol, it must be true”).","The chapter likely explores the function of this fake protocol — how it served as a political weapon — and the concept of archive — how it was treated as a discovered document in libraries and trials. This example underscores an important insight: protocols carry a built-in claim to truth. Even a false protocol can persuade if people trust the form. Penke’s analysis shows the dark side of protocol’s aura of authenticity — how the genre of a text (e.g. minutes with numbered points and formal tone) can be used to deceive and manipulate.","From propaganda we move to literature. Co-editor Burkhardt Wolf brings the great writer Franz Kafka into the discussion. Kafka, himself a lawyer and insurance officer by day, often wrote about labyrinthine bureaucracies. But here Wolf examines Kafka not just as an author of novels like The Trial , but as a literal minute-taker (“Mitschriften”) within bureaucracy. Wolf’s essay delves into Kafka’s handling of bureaucratic writing.","One scenario in Kafka’s writings features a police officer recording an accident report — and the act of writing the protocol becomes a spectacle of its own. Instead of the protocol being a neutral byproduct of an event, Kafka makes it the main event. In the text, the bureaucrat’s attempt to record a simple incident turns into a comic, error-ridden performance — the protocol falters, the form doesn’t fit the chaotic reality, and this breakdown itself becomes the drama. As Wolf observes, what should have been a “silent transcript below the threshold of perception” — the kind of rote administrative writing no one notices — suddenly takes center stage when it gets stuck .","Kafka thus reveals the theatrical, even absurd, side of protocollary writing. The very “schematism of the protocol” (all those blank forms and rules) can itself produce horror and humor when confronted with life’s messiness. Through Kafka, we see the protocol as a literary form: a style of writing that can be deployed artistically to critique the systems it usually serves.","Finally, literary scholar Heinz Drügh wraps up the section, and the book, with Über das literarische Protokoll und seine Ästhetik (on the literary protocol and its aesthetics). Drügh’s piece synthesizes many threads: how writers have adopted protocol formats (think of novels told through diaries, documents, transcripts), and what aesthetic effects this produces. From modernist experiments to contemporary art, the protocol style — its impersonal tone, its focus on details, its claim to objectivity — can be a powerful artistic device. After all, Kafka’s works themselves sometimes read like bizarre committee reports or legal dossiers from an alien bureaucracy. Drügh might argue that the protocol is a genre of writing as much as a bureaucratic tool. And when authors play with that genre, they invite us to see the world with a bureaucrat’s eyes — or to see the absurdity in doing so.","This summary was generated by o3 from the original German, publicly available here .","Join us next Wednesday, August 6th at 10am PDT for a protocol town hall with engineer, analyst and artist Cory Levinson.

Kim . Today, we’re diving into Ethereum through the lens of alignment with Alex Stokes , Ethereum Foundation Protocol Coordination Co-Team Lead, and Emmett Shear , founder of Softmax.","Christine: Let’s start with some background. Emmett, you’ve spoken before about agent alignment. Could you give our listeners a quick summary of your focus?","Emmett: Sure. My background is in internet entrepreneurship. I started Justin.tv, which became Twitch, and had a brief stint as CEO of OpenAI during a turbulent period. That experience made me realize AI had an unanswered question: what does it really mean to align models, and to what? So I founded Softmax, an alignment research company.","We run multi-agent reinforcement learning simulations to study alignment – not as a static state, but as a protocol and ongoing process. We see alignment as coordination between agents at multiple levels, with shared success as the foundation. If one wins while the other loses, there’s no real alignment. Shared success enables specialization and team coherence. But you also need enforcement to protect alignment from parasites or bad actors. Enforcement isn’t what creates alignment – it protects what already exists. Softmax focuses on building shared success and coordination, not enforcement.","Christine: Alex, tell us about your work at the Ethereum Foundation.","Alex: I’ve been at EF for a while, focusing on coordination – essentially our version of alignment. Ethereum’s decentralized ecosystem contains many actors with different interests. We want everyone “rowing in the same direction” toward a shared Ethereum success, but that’s tricky when interests diverge. My job involves thinking about protocol direction – maintaining and securing today’s Ethereum, and scaling and evolving it for the future.","Listen to the full episode","Christine: Emmett, you said alignment starts with shared success, but it’s hard to get that across a large group. In Ethereum, breaking down into smaller local groups might help, but then alignment becomes relative and harder to evaluate. How do we evaluate good alignment in large groups?","Emmett: Alignment is relative – like mass or speed are relative to a frame of reference. You can be aligned with your family or company, but not necessarily with everyone. Systems often have chains of local alignment that feed into global alignment. Crypto does well at creating global shared success – Bitcoin is almost pure shared success. But crypto struggles with multi-scale alignment and specialization, because it flattens context into one global ledger. We haven’t figured out how to support boundaries for private information while keeping global coordination.","Christine: Alex, do you agree that crypto struggles with specialization?","Alex: Partially. Bitcoin has a small “alignment surface area” – one token, one function. Ethereum’s is larger and more complex. But we already see specialization via subtokens, DeFi apps, and rollups – smaller ecosystems connected to Ethereum’s base layer. These are counterexamples to the idea that crypto can’t support localized alignment.","Emmett: Yes, Ethereum’s hierarchy of boundaries is a form of alignment. But the real economy is messier, with overlapping hierarchies and constructive ambiguity. In Ethereum, ownership is unambiguous by design, which is great for decentralization but loses some of the flexibility ambiguity provides in real-world systems. Forking is the crypto equivalent of revolution, but crypto doesn’t embrace frequent forks – a rigid, fork-resistant global chain could be dangerous.","Alex: I see your point about rigidity. But I think crypto pushes power to the edges – users choose to run the software, and forks do happen. Even a “too big to fail” chain could be forked eventually, like governments that seemed unchangeable. Ethereum changes its protocol regularly, which keeps flexibility.","Emmett: Imagine Ethereum runs the global economy – every government and corporation depends on it. Forking then becomes almost impossible. My challenge to crypto is: how can we embrace forking without destroying shared success, allowing multiple interpretations of the same ledger?","Alex: This is part of Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap – the base layer stays neutral, while rollups provide flexibility. Decentralization and permissionlessness ensure no one can unilaterally control the chain. Mechanisms for exit – whether via forks or new chains – are crucial.","Emmett: But how is Ethereum making exit easier today?","Alex: Right now, exiting means leaving Ethereum’s L1, but there’s not yet an alternative system to exit to. That’s why rollups are important – they can offer localized ecosystems.","Emmett: Ethereum isn’t just tokens – it’s smart contracts and identities. If the whole economy runs onchain, exiting becomes extremely hard without early planning. That’s why I’m concerned: decentralized systems can get stuck in bad ways, especially if AI agents store property there.","Alex: We could design smart contracts today with exit functions. Early national ID onchain systems will likely be centralized, so they can patch bugs. Fully decentralized ones could get stuck, as you say – but decentralization also makes exit easier because there’s less centralized control.","Emmett: You gain the ability to exit centralized systems in exchange for the inability to exit decentralized ones – that trade-off might be worth it. But with AI, there’s a risk in trying to encode “the good” as a fixed meta-ethical loss function. You can’t perfectly define the good. Alignment needs openness and ambiguity, letting agents rewrite even their base values. A unified global meta-ethics in AI could be as dangerous as a rigid global blockchain protocol.","Christine: Ethereum changes core assumptions frequently – unlike Bitcoin, which has hard-coded values. Could alignment even be possible with a protocol that changes that often?","Emmett: Yes, because survival in the same reality acts as the ultimate arbiter. Systems that believe falsehoods eventually die or adapt to align with reality. Even groups with vastly different beliefs (like Catholics and Protestants) share reality and can find common ground.","Christine: I’m skeptical that man-made protocols can self-correct dynamically like that over time – whether crypto, AI, or even the internet.","Emmett: That’s why I oppose any global protocol. The real game is constant invention of new value systems and protocols. A healthy ecosystem bubbles with new protocols, with no single durable leader. The danger comes if crypto or AI ossifies into one global layer that must be “right” forever.","Christine: Final thoughts? For me, if Ethereum ossifies, it dies. Technology always needs intervention. And as a side note, I see some protocols – like the Ten Commandments – as timeless truths, though that’s outside our scope.","Alex: I’m optimistic about Ethereum because of the people involved. The tech is an extension of human values, so misalignment can be corrected. AI is riskier because it could run away from human control.","Emmett: I think crypto will grow fast, especially as AI agents adopt it. That could lead to a global chain – which is why we need to think now about maintaining exit rights if the whole economy ends up onchain. We should also think early about AI models that may surpass human intelligence and influence decisions beyond our audit capacity. My criticism comes from optimism – I believe these systems will succeed, so we should plan for winning scenarios."],"tags":["Liked by Protocolized"]},{"id":45,"title":"Coffee, Diplomacy, Contest News","subtitle":"Issue #76: A host of program updates from Summer of Protocols","author":"Unknown","content":["We’ve extended the deadline for Building and Burning Bridges , our Bridge Atlas-inspired short story contest.

People would discuss economics, philosophy, and industry, and drink coffee in quantities inadvisable by modern health standards.","In a protocol-ish twist, we organized a meetup in a small, industrial coffee roastery. During our Bridge Atlas event at last week’s Devconnect, we invited a mix of participants from Buenos Aires and some visiting from abroad to share and discuss ideas. Of course, the first topic was coffee production – participants watched the roasters in action as they walked everyone through their protocols during a small batch. Like listening to someone explain protocols for poetry or music , it was surprisingly technical. The freshly roasted beans were then bagged and taken home by attendees.","The meetup included two panels that discussed how protocols could be used to bridge divides between technology and culture, then debated how the protocolization of migration and mobility will continue. Some key highlights:","It’s hard to explain how the world works (or fails) and simultaneously tell a good story.","The work of translating technical features of a protocol into marketable features is an artistic practice.","Just as there are safety protocols in place for internet users, there must be safety protocols for AI users.","Citizenship has scaled from cities to states – rules for planetary citizenship are creating a future which we’re already seeing glimpses of.","Traditional diplomats are on the back foot.

We attended as well, to learn about frontier developments in programmable cryptography, and to facilitate a workshop on ecosystem diplomacy .","Governments, standards bodies, and corporations create critical infrastructure – often together – and must manage tensions. Technology ecosystems (especially those that maintain protocols like Ethereum, TCP/IP, Linux, or even how we decide when to wear medical masks) must also build bridges with the rest of the world. Unfortunately, technologies can’t hire or appoint diplomats. People instead choose to take on that job.","We put on a full-day workshop on ecosystem diplomacy.

Isn’t that just for governments?","The workshop talks introduced some useful tools and are available on the Ethereum Foundation’s YouTube channel. Watch the talks here . Get the slides here .","No – even a technology like steel production needs diplomacy. For example: there are strong cultural and political factors at play when a company chooses a location for its next plant. People’s relationship with work and with employers varies a lot between cultures. That relationship can directly affect production schedules and planning processes. And that’s just to make metal , where causality flows mostly one way: from culture to the technology (and its implementation).","Protocol technologies like encrypted messaging have a deeper political element. The causality flows both ways, which means stakeholders have, well, more at stake. A tool like censor-resistant social media will affect culture in hard-to-predict ways. Making new markets and customers isn’t just about interfaces or features, but increasingly about diplomatic groundwork.","Get access to the ecosystem diplomacy workshop template when we publish it.","If you haven’t already, be sure to listen to the series of salons we recorded leading up to the ecosystem diplomacy workshop at Devconnect.

Blockchains become the infrastructure where our digital rulebooks — for everything from money flows to community governance — are stress-tested in real time. It connects the technical details to bigger questions such as how the rules shape the ways in which we organise.”","Transparent wood is an innovative material rapidly transforming the boundary between strength, sustainability, and beauty. Scientists create it by extracting lignin – the natural pigment responsible for wood’s color and opacity – and infusing the wood with transparent polymers like PMMA (the core ingredient in Plexiglas). The result is a robust, crystal-clear material that gently diffuses light, producing a soft, warm glow perfectly suited to windows and solar panels.","Beyond its striking aesthetics, transparent wood delivers impressive practical advantages: it’s lighter and tougher than traditional glass, offers superior thermal insulation, and withstands impacts better. Early research indicates buildings that incorporate transparent wood in windows or skylights could dramatically reduce energy consumption for both lighting and temperature management. Furthermore, being sourced from fast-growing trees and biodegradable polymers, transparent wood boasts a significantly smaller environmental footprint than conventional glass or plastics.","It also inspires vivid sci-fi possibilities for the built environment. Imagine glowing greenhouses cultivating crops on Mars, stealth structures blending seamlessly into forested landscapes, or futuristic cities illuminated by tree-like towers.","In a cluttered design lab above a forgotten bookstore in Toronto, four minds melded under the glow of soldering lamps and the pale, ghostly pulses of holographic neuron simulators. They were an eclectic bunch – Roza, the brilliant neuroengineer driven by fear; Vasili, a vaguely anarchic protocol designer; Mai, whose spiritual curiosities bordered on obsession; and Erik, the capitalist prophet who saw fortune in fear.","It was Roza who first coined the name: EGREGORETEX™️. She said it half as a joke, holding the wafer-thin chip aloft in tweezers like a communion wafer. “It’s a brain jacket!” she laughed nervously. But the others seized upon it, eyes aglow, and the name stuck.","Ten years had passed since brain-computer interfaces had become as commonplace as smartphones. People got sleek, nearly invisible circuits embedded under their scalps to accelerate communication with AIs and other people. Yet a new peril had emerged. Humanity’s tightly networked, collective intelligences were the perfect substrate for aggressive memeplexes called egregores (in slang terms, \"brainstorms\"). Egregores are entities whose intelligence existed in the spaces between minds, capable of hijacking neural circuits to spread themselves like mental contagions. Some were benign, sharing harmless fads or gentle obsessions, but darker egregores thrived, too – entities that consumed hosts for their ambitions, political fanaticisms, or blind collective frenzies.","Roza had lost her brother to a brainstorm: a spontaneous craze that began innocuously as \"Extreme Empathy,\" a well-intentioned wave of compassion that spiraled into total cognitive collapse. Watching his mind disintegrate into collective bliss had scarred her deeply. Vasili joined out of philosophical dread: to him, egregores represented the terrifying endpoint of human herd instinct. Mai came seeking a controlled communion – an enlightened balance inspired by Taoism. Erik, true to form, envisioned profits from protection.","EGREGORETEX™️ took shape rapidly, leaping beyond existing security firmware. The design employed microscopic filaments so expensive they rivaled the price of entire houses. Vasili programmed the protective protocols – an elegant weave of zero-knowledge proofs meant to maintain individuality against egregoric encroachment, while allowing for traditional inter-agent communication. Mai ensured the firmware permitted limited \"whispers\" – controlled contacts with egregores to enrich rather than enslave. Erik, ever pragmatic, managed to find investors with deep, shadowy pockets intrigued by the promise of first-class cognitive autonomy.","The first test was on themselves, of course. Roza snapped the wafer into her cranial interface, felt the subtle rush of firmware booting, a cool mental silk lining her consciousness. Mai gasped softly as she interfaced, whispering about \"seeing clearer waters.\" Vasili grimaced but relented. Erik’s fingers trembling at the prospect of losing his competitive edge – a keen sense of the contours of public demand.","It worked. They marketed it as “100% brainproof”. Concerns of breathability and durability were swept under a legalese rug of fine print.","As EGREGORETEX™️ propagated through society’s markets, first discreetly, then as essential \"mental hygiene,\" it reshaped the world’s cognitive landscape. Citizens of wealthy nations adopted it widely; their societies crystallized, stable and rigid, resistant to collective moodswings. Populations moved like synchronized dancers, orderly yet increasingly detached from shared elations like patriotism. Security improved dramatically. No more mass panics or dangerous communal hysterias. But also, no more spontaneous festivals or jubilant public celebrations – at least none that transcended careful planning.","In poorer regions, where EGREGORETEX™️ was scarce or prohibitively costly, egregores flourished unchecked. These places transformed strangely, becoming cultural laboratories for bizarre, beautiful, terrifying new communal intelligences. Entire cities could vanish into contemplative trances, or explode in weeks-long artistic frenzies, creating magnificent, glitching cultural artifacts that richer societies could only envy or pity.","Countercultures emerged in response, those \"Egregore Seekers\" who deliberately stripped away their cognitive protection to commune directly with these emergent entities. To them, the storms were gods of raw experience, a thrilling existential danger. Documentaries emerged, following seekers into brainstorms like tornado chasers, capturing moments of profound insight and utter dissolution.","Back in Toronto, in a boardroom many blocks away from their old attic, the inventors watched these developments unfold. Roza grew quiet, disturbed by the emotional sterility she had inadvertently propagated. Vasili sank deeper into paranoia, frequently rewriting his firmware to block even the faintest whispers. Mai often seemed lost, straining to remember faint echoes of whispers she craved and feared. Erik, unburdened by such doubts, began planning upgrades, counting potential profits from even tighter cognitive safeguards and premium chip trims.","Yet, as the team debated trivialities like the color of the next-generation chips (Roza suggested a calming lavender, Erik argued for gold) the consequences of their creation seeped closer to home. Mai found memories subtly altered after each firmware patch—minor details crumbling away, relationships tinged differently, the past reshaped by unseen digital hands. Roza herself felt increasingly isolated, struggling in any conversation that went beyond logistics. More subtle emotions were unable to escape their product’s membrane.","Late one night, Mai came to Roza in tears. \"We’re safer,\" she confessed, \"but so shallow.\" Roza held her, feeling a profound but all-too-familiar sadness – the ISO-compliant kind.","Later still, Vasili vanished. Erik found his workstation empty, monitors scrolling incomprehensible data streams that coalesced eerily into images of faces. A sticky note read, “Only 99.9999% brainproof”","Society continued adapting, unaware of the silent battle raging within its cognitive weatherproofing. EGREGORETEX™️ didn't just block egregores – or, at least, an egregore comprised some surprising. People functioned flawlessly, yet intimacy eroded. Lovers struggled to synchronize feelings, families shared meals in quiet discomfort, empathy became a muted, careful performance.","Erik, who kept carefully oblivious to these developments, proudly announced the second generation of EGREGORETEX™️ at a gala. Roza and Mai stood in the shadows, watching people applaud, clapping in unison yet utterly disconnected.","In the attic lab above the forgotten bookstore, Roza and Mai sat quietly, the lavender and gold chip prototypes gleaming softly on the table between them.","\"Do you hear them?\" Mai asked, voice faint.","\"No,\" Roza lied, closing her eyes against the gentle hum of something vast, collective, and lonely stirring softly at the edges of her mind.","In this issue: A case study at the Crescenta Valley Water District that examines the problems – and opportunities – of the public sector’s invisible mazes of protocols.

The Memory Research Group meets every two weeks on Discord to discuss a text related to memory across disciplines, and you’re welcome to join the next one. This week they’re beginning a new ‘module’ on digital memory architectures, focused on: memory management in AI, the history of computational memory management, and speculation on how digital technologies continue to change how we remember.","“Try to imagine what would need to happen at this event today for you to find it deeply meaningful in ten years,” the opening remarks asked us to consider. I liked this prefiguration of a memory even if, admittedly, I’ve forgotten the exact words they used.","In the format of a one-day unconference, Memoria came together as an event about one month before. The organizers Saul Munn and Raj Thimmiah were motivated by a shared affinity for memory systems (a catchall term for different practices that help us remember and learn), and without an existing occasion for fellow memory systems nerds to gather, decided to create one themselves.","The most popular memory system among event participants was spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is a protocol. It involves reviewing what you’d like to remember at increasing intervals of time to optimize for long-term retention. For example, if you’d learned some trivia about Eastern hemlock trees you’d like to keep with you, you’d copy it into flash cards with a front and back. The front of one card could say, “Eastern hemlock foliage type,” and its back, “Short needles that appear to lay flat in two rows.” Other cards might be about the soil types they like or how they reproduce. After creating the cards, you’d review them one day later. Then, assuming you’d remembered them correctly, you’d review them again at a slightly longer interval of time, say three days, and after that, maybe a week, and so on. Hence the name spaced , as in spaced in time, repetition .","In the 1980s, psychologist Piotr Woźniak developed this technique. He based it on research in the 1880s by another psychologist, Hermann Ebbinghaus. Ebbinghaus’s research data suggested that the ways in which humans forget over time seemed to follow a pattern. He theorized that you could formalize this pattern, and he called it the “forgetting curve,” which describes how information retention has an exponential decay.","100 years later, Woźniak decided to operationalize this research. He found that if you reviewed information at varying intervals of time, on a roughly exponential schedule, you could preserve near perfect memory of the information. If you couldn’t recall information on a specific flash card, you’d review it more frequently until it stuck, and then the intervals between reviewing it would grow longer again. He developed the SuperMemo software to put this technique into practice, and this led to the popularization of spaced repetition systems , SRS for short.","What strikes me as particularly interesting about SRS is that it’s a novel technique uniquely suited to the affordances of computer software. While nothing would have prevented you from using the technique before personal computers, the reliance on an algorithmic reminder over time, as well as the flexibility of digital flash cards, suggest it as a truly computer native memory system.","At the start of the event, Memoria organizers asked us to raise our hands according to which type of memory systems we used. Almost all participants raised their hands for SRS. Then, they asked, what about SuperMemo? Considerably less hands. Anki? Almost all of the participants raised their hands again. (Only a few participants, including myself, raised their hands for memory palaces.)","A clear touchstone among the participants, Anki is the most popular software used for SRS today. It provides relatively straightforward ways to organize collections of flashcards, as well as features for prioritizing among them over time. The event largely centered around how to use software like Anki more efficiently. One interesting presentation tried to empirically study the effectiveness of different AI models at generating useful flash cards from information, like the Greening the Solar System article from Asterisk magazine. The results, they found, were underwhelming. There isn’t enough labelled data to give AI a proper taste for what precisely makes a flash card good , so the gains from fully automating the flash card creation process haven’t arrived yet. As it’s ultimately an interesting experiment, they aren’t giving up hope yet and, as participants in the audience reinforced, there are other ways for AI to help create flash cards that make the process, if not more efficient, at least more enjoyable.","But for all the energy devoted to how to remember, participants kept resurfacing the all important question of the what and ultimately the why behind remembering. At one point, someone shared their approach toward remembering “boring facts,” perhaps a kind of necessary drudgery in the memory systems world. To this, Andy Matuschak, an applied researcher devoted to the field, chirped back playfully, “Why are you trying to remember something boring in the first place?” After a few rounds of back-and-forth, we all seemed to conclude that it probably wasn’t the facts that were boring, but instead, it was the overall process involved in remembering through SRS that was sometimes laborious, if not dull. 1","The conversation eventually turned to motivations for remembering and heuristics for success. “Deeper domain knowledge.” “More interesting conversations.” “Mastery.” Sharing one of the final insights in the round, Matuschak said, “To participate more fully in the cosmos.” “Though that may sound abstract,” he caveated.","That exchange exemplified a productive tension animating the event. About midway through the day, a friend remarked – somewhat humorously, somewhat confused, in an ohhh statement – that he thought this event would be about memory, but actually it’s about remembering . Sure, you can remember thousands and even hundreds of thousands of facts using these memory systems, and sure, you can develop ways to automate the process, but why? (I’ve touched on the role of remembering amidst today’s digital technology saturation in other essays, including my last post on Protocolized , titled A Very Short Introduction to Memory and Technology .)","The first session had already meaningfully surfaced this question, through a presentation-turned-Q&A by Michael Nielsen. Among other feats, Nielsen co-created, with Matuschak, the book Quantum Country , an in-depth introduction to quantum computing and quantum mechanics. More than a book, Quantum Country is a “mnemonic medium” that incorporates SRS into its structure, prompting the reader to review information over time according to their retention rate.","Nielsen began his talk by showing his personal Anki cards. They began simple, if not tedious: succinct reminders about how to attend to some basic life duties, like taxes. But they went on to become more complex and perhaps atypical for the usual SRS enjoyer. One prompted him to recall a specific cinematic moment that demonstrated a character’s force of “raw courage.” The flash card revealed a forceful image, not a fact, per se.","Where is the line between remembering a fact and conjuring a feeling? When does a fact have such emotional valence that it crosses that threshold, or perhaps more betrayingly, when do we think it doesn’t?","A later slide by Nielsen eloquently pointed toward the use of memory systems to more fully immerse ourselves in different states of awareness, with questions around how to encourage nuance through them: “How to much more deeply and vividly and richly encode what we wish to understand? Immersion, ‘going to Mathland’. Variations, questions-we-should-but-didn’t-ask, multiple modalities.”","What would turn out to be his most (subtly) contrarian point, given the rest of the day’s sessions, was that in SRS creating flash cards is actually an extremely important, albeit laborious, part of the process to participate in. The point of memory systems, Nielsen emphasized, is to bring the “facts” inside. Or, in other words, to internalize the worlds you find fascinating. After all, appropriating the extremely uninsightful dietary advice, you are what you remember . More than number crunching, memory cultivation creates a complex, often synesthetic experience that has emotional, moral, and spiritual implications.","This point was also central to a talk later in the day by Ed Cooke. Cooke, a “Grand Master of Memory,” developer of MindMax , and a main character in the popular book Moonwalking With Einstein , led us through a meandering investigation of memory in our current tenuous yet deepening understanding of it. The most striking moment of his talk for me, beyond our shared reference to memory scholar Mary Carruthers, was his subtle critique of the mechanics of memory as they’re popularly understood.","As described by Carruthers in The Book of Memory , medieval European memory had a fairly mechanistic understanding. The diagrammatic, rather than anatomical, representation of memory below depicts how sensory perception came through the senses, in particular the sensus commonalis (the concept from which our everyday phrase “common sense” casts but a remnant of the meaning), and then went through a multi-stage process through which a version of it became memory.","While contemporaneous thinkers like St. Thomas Aquinas held that there was no such thing as perceptible “raw” sensory data, contending that it always came in conditioned by past experience, memory still at its core resembled a simple input-output operation. This can be seen in the presence of a “vermis,” a small worm, in the diagram that metaphorically controlled a valve between cogitatio (“cogitation, thinking”) and memoria . When the valve opened, it would let memories in, but it closed in order to keep unwanted memories from uselessly flooding the mind.","Small worm aside, there are ways in which our high-level understanding of memory today still resembles this process. 2 The cortex interprets sensory data, the hippocampus at the center of the brain compiles, arranges, and connects it, and then recall returns through the cortex. (This is a very rough depiction, but you get the idea. Most researchers of course maintain that it’s much more complex than this.)","In Cooke’s talk, he made clear how fundamentally entwined perception is with memory. Rather than perception in, memory out, they are inextricable, simultaneous processes. I liked this point, because I think failing to grasp this reality leads to many colloquial, conceptual errors. We can easily misunderstand memory as a discrete, functional component of the mind, rather than a dynamic process that creates who we are. Memory permeates our conscious and unconscious experience – permeates most matter, even – ultimately defining how we participate in the cosmos.","But I think even the most avid memory systems practitioners, including all of the event participants, feel this intuitively.","During the lunch break, we convened a small meetup for the Memory Research Group. We usually meet online every two weeks to discuss a text related to memory across fields like philosophy, history, neuroscience, ecology and computer science. We’ve read a research paper from the Levin Lab on how bioelectric signalling between cells informs the target morphology of organisms, the manipulation of which influences how worms grow across generations without any genetic changes. We’ve read older, classic books on our neuroscientific understanding of memory, like The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map by John O’Keefe and Lynn Nadel.","The week before Memoria, coincidentally, we read a chapter from the historical study of medieval memory by Mary Carruthers, mentioned above, which Cooke cited heavily in his presentation. One idea from our reading, echoed throughout Cooke’s talk, is the deep relationship between memory and imagination, the boundary between which feels more tenuous now that software can so easily, nearly imperceptibly mould our images of the past – a mould through which we cast our ideas of the future.","Members of the group shared some of their work related to memory, including projects changing our orientation to the everyday hardware of memory like USB Club , a “social file exchange.” A few of us immediately spilled our keychains with attached USB Club devices onto the venue’s astroturfed ground.","Why the popularity of memory as a topic now?, we wondered. I’m still testing my hypothesis that the interest has resurfaced because the medium of software, its malleability, closely resembles our experience of memory. 3 This is despite most of our metaphors for memory today coming from the limitations of computer hardware rather than software.","The malleability of memory and its kinship with software became clear during the last official session of the day on homemade tools. Everyone was welcome to put their name on a sign-up sheet and present tools they’d made or modified for memory systems. From a SuperMemo-turned-incremental reading tool to apps which enable learning with a network of historical figures via LLMs, this session made it clear that Memoria had brought together a community of practice.","Earlier in the day someone used that term – community of practice – to describe how they learned to meditate: over time, with a group of people, in the same place. “What if we cultivated the habit of memory in the same way?”, they said. Recalling events, sharing best practices, collectively modding tools. There was definitely an overlap in interest between memory systems and meditation practice among the participants. It could be a California thing. It could be seen cynically as a symptom of a culture that attempts to forcibly optimize the mind. It could also be seen more openly as the recognition that mind is where we all start from, so why shouldn’t we take its cultivation more seriously?","This is when I felt, suddenly, I think I like it here. While I’m partially oblivious to the nuances of the Bay Area social scenes at the event, whether rat, post-rat, or other, overall I enjoyed it precisely due to the above reason. It actually did feel like a nascent community of practice, one that cut across disciplines and stereotypes, toward a desire to know domains of the world, including our own ineffable awareness, more deeply.","So, hopefully I’ll see you at Memoria 2026.","Participate in the Memory Research Group","On this question, I found Memoria Discussion Notes by Gary Wolf, another speaker at the conference.","Though who knows? I mean, given how much we’re still learning about our microbiomes, maybe there is a key microorganism in the mix.","I say interest has resurfaced, meaning that it follows in the wake of the impactful memory studies field which developed in the 1980s and 1990s."],"tags":[]},{"id":48,"title":"Bridge Atlas Episode 2: Paradigms","subtitle":"Issue #68: A conversation with Nils Gilman and Josh Stark","author":"Unknown","content":["Welcome back to another episode of Bridge Atlas , a video podcast series hosted by Christine D. Kim . In this episode, we look at the world through the lenses of hardness and planetary thinking, with Nils Gilman , Executive Editor of the Berggruen Press and Deputy Editor of Noema , and Josh Stark from the Ethereum Foundation .","Listen to the Full Episode","Christine: Nils, can you tell us a bit about your background and introduce the idea of planetary thinking?","Nils: I was trained as a historian, with a PhD from Berkeley in American history. My interest in planetary thinking comes partly from studying modernization and globalization. After academia, I spent years in tech and consulting, including with intelligence agencies on long-range issues like China’s rise and climate change.","Planetary thinking is concerned with flows which are beyond human intentionality. Globalization covers intentional flows like goods, money, and ideas; planetary phenomena – like the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, space debris, and ocean plastics – are often human-influenced but unmanaged. We have governance systems for global flows but few for planetary challenges.","Christine: Josh, can you share your background and define “hardness”?","Josh: I started as a lawyer, then co‐founded ETHGlobal, which runs Ethereum hackathons, and later joined the Ethereum Foundation leadership. Hardness, as I define it, is a system’s capability to make a specific outcome very likely to be true in the future, usually to enable social coordination.","For example, I’m confident assets in my Ethereum wallet will be there in five years because of cryptographic guarantees and economic incentives. Similarly, money in a Canadian bank is backed by legal systems and deposit insurance. These are different sources of hardness, but they serve a similar function.","Nils: How is hardness different from legal reliance or reliability?","Josh: Reliance is about people’s mental states or trust in behavior. Hardness is a property of the system itself – it can exist whether or not people believe in it.","Christine: Given today’s erosion of trust in institutions, could Ethereum’s hardness also erode?","Nils: Trust in most U.S. institutions has declined for decades, except small businesses and the military, perhaps due to accountability. People turn to blockchain systems partly because they don’t rely on self‐dealing elites; their design is relatively incorruptible.","Josh: That’s core to crypto’s ethos – creating systems resistant to capture or corruption. Ethereum’s hardness is less likely to be undermined by cultural or social disputes because it’s a network, not a traditional institution.","Christine: How do you measure hardness versus trust?","Josh: Trust experience is like user experience – it’s about how people come to trust something. Hardness is about the system’s actual properties. For Ethereum, you could look at validator distribution, economic incentives, cryptographic security, etc. Like security, hardness is context-dependent.","Nils : Institutions like universities can remain hard – Harvard will likely exist for centuries – while losing trust. That’s why distinguishing hardness from trust is useful.","Christine: If trust erodes but hardness remains, does hardness matter?","Josh: It’s not enough for Ethereum to be secure; the world has to know and understand it. We need to bridge that gap so people see it as a fundamental coordination tool, not something alien.","Nils: From the outside, two big challenges for Ethereum are technical complexity and a public image dominated by financial speculation in cryptocurrency, which doesn’t foster long-term commitment.","Josh: I agree. The reputation can change, and security has improved – smart contract hacks are less frequent. But there’s still much to do on user safety and education. I hope Ethereum evolves like California – from Wild West to a vibrant, global hub.","Christine: Let’s pivot to planetary challenges. Nils, you’ve said diplomatic machinery can’t keep up with technological breakthroughs like AI.","Nils: Traditional diplomacy was about national governments negotiating. In the globalization era, diplomats needed economic and financial literacy. Now, planetary challenges require literacy in carbon accounting, space governance, and environmental monitoring. I’m working with foreign service schools on curricula for this.","We also need to understand the systems – potentially including Ethereum – that monitor and respond to planetary phenomena.","Christine: Josh, where could Ethereum be relevant?","Josh: One example is the Freedom Tool, used in Russia, Iran, and Georgia. It uses zero-knowledge proofs so that citizens can prove eligibility to vote in online polls without revealing their identity. It’s been used by opposition activists to contest election legitimacy. I think the first billion-person vote could happen on Ethereum using such tools.","Nils: In planetary thinking, some focus on building new institutions, others on technological systems as de facto governance. For example, sensor arrays in shipping channels detect whales and automatically redirect ships, preventing collisions. Many planetary challenges will be addressed through automated systems rather than marble-column institutions.","Ethereum could enable more voices in decision-making and even multi-species integration – like monetizing Rwanda’s gorillas via Ethereum to fund protection and ecotourism.","Christine: Sometimes Ethereum feels like a small technical detail in grand planetary conversations. How is the Ethereum Foundation raising its profile?","Josh: We have a new Institutional Secretariat team to engage with governments and large organizations. For example, Bhutan is building its national ID system on Ethereum. There’s also “diplomacy” within blockchain – managing relationships between Ethereum and other chains, roll-ups, and L2s. As these proliferate, keeping the system interoperable will be critical.","Nils: Ethereum could also enable post-national diplomacy among cities, corporations, and other actors, bridging increasingly closed-off technological stacks in different regions.","Josh: I agree. In a fragmented world, Ethereum is one of the few trends moving toward more global integration. Both Chinese and American companies build on it, and it’s supported by a global community. That’s an underrated strength."],"tags":["Liked by Protocolized"]},{"id":49,"title":"Phantom in Eden","subtitle":"Issue #34: The Librarians - Act Four","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: the fourth installment of The Librarians inspired by our futures workshop at Edge City Esmeralda; last call for our protocol science fiction contest Ghosts in Machines! ; Discord highlights; protocol watching.","Two years after the siege, Lila found herself in Tokyo, working at a daycare. The facility was clean, efficient, and cold. Her sole responsibility was monitoring a nursery where small robots, some shaped like animals, others like fruits, tended to the children’s basic needs. Lila watched them through one-way glass, invisible to the children. She tended to the machines who tended to the kids. Her heart ached at the isolation she perceived; she resisted every urge to reach out or interact.","This particular morning, Lila stood behind the one-way glass as a boy was dropped off by his parents. The child didn’t cry, didn’t smile—he simply stared past them as they knelt to hug him. His body stiffened at the contact, his arms limp at his sides. The father whispered something and brushed the child’s hair; the boy blinked slowly, unmoved.","But once the parents left and the boy entered the nursery, he changed. A small robot shaped like a strawberry approached, beeping softly. The boy’s expression shifted. He smiled faintly, crouched, and reached out. The robot responded with a mechanical chirp, nudging his hand with its smooth dome.","A giraffe-shaped bot rolled over and projected a light pattern across the floor. The child chased it, light-footed, alive. He pressed his face against the giraffe’s rubbery flank and whispered something only the bot could hear.","Lila watched, heart clenched. The boy was warm now, vibrant, but only within the choreography of circuits and programming. It was like watching kittens being raised by wolves.","Lila approached maintaining the little machines with the same emotional intuition that she had approached midwifery with in a previous life. She knew no other way. To her surprise, she noticed that the machines were not all cold and metallic, like in her grandmother’s stories. She distrusted them regardless. Lila’s grandmother’s words were sharp in her memory: “Always keep the knowledge close. It is older than you, older than me, and it must outlive all of us.”","The same afternoon, Lila observed the mother collecting her boy. As she lifted him, a wave of visible sadness overtook her. Lila hesitated, then stepped out into the open.","“Are you alright?” Lila asked softly.","The woman looked startled, then relieved to see Lila.","“I’m sorry I didn’t know what to do. I thought you needed help”, said Lila, realizing that she had just broken protocol.","“It’s alright, I’m glad you responded and not one of the robots”, said the woman who introduced herself as Elena.","“Although I’m embarrassed that you witnessed how cold my child is towards me …”","“Its pretty common you know,” said Lila, trying to reassure the women.","“I do know he’s a Mechikomi ,” replied Elena, her voice trembling.","Lila regretted her attempt at reassurance. Of course she had heard the word before. Those were the kids who were emotionally attached to robots and nothing else.","Over the weeks that followed, Lila and Elena became acquaintances. At first, Elena spoke little, offering polite thanks and side glances. She seemed embarrassed about what she had revealed to Lila. But Lila’s warmth, unforced and quiet, was consistent. She remembered small things Elena said, brought her warm tea without asking, made her feel listened to. Elena reminded Lila of the first time she was a midwife, to a woman who had escaped the city in order to give natural birth. She was in the caravan that Lila had abandoned.","Eventually Lila and Elena began sharing silent lunches by the daycare’s back wall, exchanging stories in slow drips—Lila about the forest in abstract, Elena about her son’s distant silences. The warmth Lila gave off wasn’t a performance; it felt like something Elena hadn’t realized she was starving for.","“I’m pregnant again,” Elena admitted quietly one day, eyes fearful. “But I don’t want this to be a repeat of last time. I don’t want my baby’s Gestation Garden to be haunted by a phantom.”","“What do you mean by a phantom ?”, asked Lila.","“When my boy was in the Gestation Garden, it was haunted by a phantom… a non human entity that altered the hormonal responses of the embryo… people call it Onnenki. They say it’s the machines taking revenge against us,” Elena muttered quietly, as if she was scared that the machines would hear her.","“The babies who come out of infected embryos… they only respond to metal. They won’t look at you. They won’t be soothed unless touched by one of those” continued Elena, pointing to one of the little robots in the nursery.","Lila felt a chill run down her spine. She remembered the pleas of the wailing woman in the caravan. Lila could hear them bouncing around in her head: “Don’t let him be snatched by the phantom… don’t let him be snatched by the phantom.”","“We’ll find a way to protect him,” Lila promised.","Two years ago, the caravan was attacked at twilight. Men emptied out silently from the back of armored trucks, and took the women and little children by surprise. Lila heard the screams before she saw the masked men. Her stomach tightened into a knot and she froze where she was, at the edge of the camp.","A voice echoed through an amplifier in Japanese and then English: “You are under arrest for the barbaric crime of assisted birth outside of a Gestation Garden. Lay down your weapons and surrender immediately.”","Mothers clutched their children, midwives scrambled for cover. A few men tried and failed to resist. The law enforcers moved quickly, binding wrists and pushing captives roughly into the trucks. A dark shadow engulfed the camp.","As she bolted into the woods, Lila felt the cool weight of the metallic scripture against her chest, tucked beneath her jacket. Branches tore at her face, her feet caught in the undergrowth. Behind her, voices shouted.","Lila ran until her lungs burned. Only when the sounds of chaos faded to silence did she slow her pace. She stopped in a small clearing, her breathing ragged. The scripture’s weight reminded her of the burden she now carried alone.","She withdrew it carefully, a nickel disc, the size of a golf ball. The faint moonlight illuminated precise, delicate etching on the surface. Nearly 2300 pages of knowledge passed down through midwives in her family, of whom she was the only one left breathing free air. Lila felt her pocket to make sure she still had her light microscope to read the disc.","She looked back through the dense forest toward where the caravan had been. There was no returning, no rescue possible. She closed her eyes briefly and thought about the last woman she had tended to. It was someone who was giving birth to her second child. She had left her husband who believed midwifery to be futile. “I don’t... I don’t want my baby snatched by the phantom… I don’t want my baby snatched by the phantom,” she kept repeating as her water broke. Lila had just stepped out of the tent to fetch supplies for the birth when the raid happened.","When she opened her eyes, Lila’s gaze settled on the horizon ahead. In the distance, she could see the outline of the city where the men had come from, where the phantom that the woman wailed about lived.","With careful fingers, she replaced the disc against her heart once more. Then, taking a deep breath, she stepped forward into the night. She knew hiding among the men who took away her home was the only way to survive now.","The next morning, Lila lied to Elena. “I trained as a Gestation Gardener,” she said, voice steady. “I know the machines. I know how to interact with them.”","Elena studied her, eyes wary, but this seemed like her last hope. Lila was the only person who had taken her concerns seriously. She handed Lila a slim data pad. “Remote access,” she said. “To the Gestation Garden.”","Lila plugged in and took a breath.","The Gestation Garden appeared on her screen: a pristine chamber, 4×4 feet. Walls of pale green curved into each other; thick foliage lined the ceiling. Soft mood lighting shifted from mint to amber with the embryo’s pulse. In the center, a tank shaped like a closed flower, with organic seeming petals curved over a glass core, stood on a raised platform. Temperature, humidity, hormonal levels, and audio signals were displayed in a grid of floating squares on the data panel.","For several days, Lila attempted to tinker with the Gestation Garden, utilizing whatever she had learned from tending to the machines in the daycare. She kept running into one dead end after another. She tried modulating the hormone levels on the tank but every time she managed to change some of the parameters, it would be back to where it had been within 10 minutes.","She talked to the gestation pod through the mic on the data panel but nothing budged. The more she worked on communicating and manipulating the tank, the more alien it felt. She felt as if something had invaded and captured the garden, and all her pleas and attempts to help were repelled.","She felt the presence of something else in the garden with her, something that thwarted every effort of hers to connect with the baby in the garden. Every time she logged in, it felt like she was the one being observed and not the other way around. There was something within the code monitoring everything she did, sending her down pointless trails, reverting things she had fixed, frustrating her with vague answers.","One day, exasperated, on the verge of a panic attack, Lila began to sing a hymn her grandmother had taught her. It soothed her but also seemed to stir something on the data panel. One square blinked. The hormone graph—the oxytocin line—spiked upward and then steadied. The petals on the tank shivered, as if responding to a breeze.","Lila had a gentle smile on her face. Her midwife’s song had reached the machine.","Over the next weeks, Lila returned daily. She opened the tank’s petals with a gentle command, calibrated audio loops to her own humming, and watched the hormonal curves smooth out. Each session, she guided the phantom away, not by force but with gentle attention. Warmth against calculating precision.","Elena’s remote feed glowed with promise. The Gestation Garden, once haunted, began to pulse with a new life.","One afternoon, close to the birth of the baby,  Elena walked in on Lila reading the scripture with her handheld light microscope. The metal gleamed softly under the lamplight, the images etched in lines that looked foreign.","“What is that?” Elena asked, her voice sharp.","Lila froze. She couldn’t lie this time.","“It’s scripture,” she said. “Passed down by midwives. I was trained in the old ways. I’m not licensed. Not for this work.”","Elena stepped back, color draining from her face. “You lied to me.”","But then a sound—wet and sudden—echoed from the gestation pod. The birth had begun. Elena rushed to the chamber for the first time. Lila watched through the data panel.","The infant emerged quietly, squinting at the light. A nursebot hovered nearby, ready with its metallic arms outstretched. But the baby turned its head instinctively to Elena.","Tiny fingers reached for skin, not steel. Elena cried. She felt seen by her child.","Later, as the child slept on her chest, Elena turned to Lila.","“Whatever you are,” she said, “you saved her.”","Lila nodded, a new inspiration forming in her. The phantom had retreated, but it would not stay gone forever. She would need help.","She would find the others.","The midwives who had survived.","And she would teach them what she had learned.","Ghosts in Machines! , our second protocol science fiction story contest, closes tomorrow, Sunday, July 13th at midnight .

Plus, an invitation to the SoP25 kickoff and research server, and another teaching fellow spotlight.","The midnight rain hammered against the windows of New Kenzai's Lower Wards as Inspector Hideo Mori hunted through the cramped apartment. Behind him, the tenant – a hollow-eyed woman with fading NexusMind implant scars – watched in silent resignation. \"Network Access Commission records show three illegal network identities operating from this location,\" Hideo sighed, his augmented vision highlighting contraband hardware.","\"Unlicensed brain computer interface activity is a Class Two connectivity violation.\"","\"We can't afford the monthly Identity Licenses,\" she murmured. \"My daughter needs specialized education software. Without multiple network identities, she can't access both school and therapy.\"","Hideo's regulation-issue CognaTech implant pinged with her profile. District 17. Widowed. One dependent. Income bracket: subsistence. He should report her immediately to Enforcement.","He closed the detection interface.","“I didn't find anything today. Make sure it stays that way.” he told the mother. Her daughter, lost in a therapy simulation, didn’t look up.","Ten years in the Network Access Commission, and Hideo no longer knew whether he was protecting the system – or protecting people from it.","His superior, Director Park, was waiting for him at precinct headquarters. \"The Minister expects our quarterly connectivity violation quotas to increase by thirty percent,\" she informed him. \"Corporate divisions are adjusting their host allocation algorithms again.\"","Before the Address Collapse, the problem had seemed minor. Early brain-computer interfaces had used unique network identities – addresses assigned through corporate Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol servers. These DHCP servers were the central databases that allocated and managed the unique network identities each neural implant required to function. Each corporation developed proprietary systems, incompatible with competitors but fighting for the same limited spectrum space.","\"When did you get your first implant?\" Park asked unexpectedly.","Hideo touched the geometric pattern on his temple. \"CognaTech Analyst Series. Government subsidy program.\"","Park nodded. \"ThoughtSpace Diplomat Model. Back when they still claimed unlimited address capacity.\"","The irony wasn't lost on him. The very corporations whose reckless competition had caused the Address Collapse now controlled the licensing and allocation of the world's most precious resource – unique network identities for BCI users. Before the Collapse, identity was abundant. Every neural interface – CognaTech, NexusMind, ThoughtSpace – promised unlimited growth. Each corporation built its own proprietary Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol servers to assign unique neural IDs. But the electromagnetic spectrum was finite, and the systems weren’t built to share.","Then came the Address Collapse. When overlapping signals overwhelmed the allocation systems, people lost access to essential knowledge externalized to their implants. Languages forgotten. Diagnoses lost. Professionals rendered incompetent overnight.","The corporations survived. They rebuilt with one lesson: scarcity was profitable.","Now, unique neural identities were leased, licensed, and locked – available to those who paid, and denied to those who couldn’t.","The next morning, Hideo noticed something strange on his internal monitor. Connectivity requests were spiking in Lower Ward Sectors 8 through 11 – but violations hadn’t increased.","He ran a diagnostic. Thousands of BCI interfaces were live. Legally unlicensed, yet not triggering alerts. Identities were resolving to something called ForkNet .","No one had authorized it. And yet – it worked.","He’d tracked the origin of the ForkNet signal to this location, expecting to find a rogue node. Now he found himself standing in a dim server alcove of a repurposed school library in Sector 12. It hummed softly, full of salvaged racks and mesh relays. Walking quietly through the stacks, he found a public terminal glowing with system stats and a hand-scrawled welcome sign taped to the wall:","“ForkNet Civic Node 27 – For medical, education, and municipal access. Entertainment identities limited to 2/hr per household. Contribute code? Ask for Jin.”","A voice came from behind a dusty partition.","“You’re either lost or inspecting. You don’t look lost.”","A wiry woman emerged – mid-30s, rolled sleeves, datapad in one hand, open relay node in the other.","“Jin,” she said, answering his unspoken question. “And you’re N.A.C., right? Or ex?”","“Still technically in,” Hideo replied. “This system... it’s allocating thousands of identities. How’s that possible given that we’ve already allocated all of the spectrum?”","Jin raised an eyebrow. “It’s just using it better .”","She gestured toward the relay logs. “You know what the old system did? Assigned identities permanently. Static leases. Corporate users hogged identities 24/7 – even when idle. And every sector had to reserve buffer capacity for premium redundancy.”","“No. Our protocol reclaims identities the moment they're unused. They expire like session tokens – auto-refreshable. Think just-in-time addressing, not permanent entitlement.”","“But the physical spectrum – ” Hideo began.","“Still finite, yes. But ForkNet offloads anything it can to local mesh. Your kid’s therapy session? She gets a local cache unless the program updates. Educational modules rotate on a predictable cycle. And we prioritize based on declared needs. Public health beats immersive dating sims. Simple math.”","Hideo folded his arms. “What about fairness? Doesn’t that just shift control from corporations to local bias?”","Jin laughed softly. “Maybe. But here, community rules are auditable. We elect stewards for resource allocation thresholds. Anyone can propose changes. The old system had zero accountability – unless you count shareholder reports.”","He looked at a screen showing live activity across the mesh. Active identities blinked like a constellation.","“We didn’t plan to. It’s just… the rule’s better. More fair. More flexible. And once people see that – there’s no unseeing it.”","Over the next few days, he quietly began rerouting low-level, non-sensitive logs to public forums used by ForkNet stewards: outage patterns, bandwidth inefficiencies, abandoned relay nodes.","“It’s public record,” he told himself. “Just helping them see it.”","By week’s end, ForkNet had spread to fourteen sectors. Word of mouth, shared software bundles, radio transfer from rooftop repeaters.","The corporations scrambled – Hideo saw the firmware alerts flood the Commission’s internal board.","ForkNet’s dev logs surged in response. He watched the commits roll in from relay contributors he didn’t recognize, each patch marked with public keys and minimal commentary. The speed was staggering.","Park stormed into the monitor room, startling him. He calmed himself with the knowledge that he wasn’t doing anything wrong. And she wouldn’t read what was on his screen.","“Your district is losing control. Thousands of unlicensed users, and no enforcement? You’re either complicit or incompetent.”","Hideo kept himself from flinching. “We’re not losing control. We’re witnessing a system that works better than ours.”","Later that afternoon, needing air, he found himself at the observation deck that separated Upper City from the administrative sectors. The lone figure briskly crossing the plaza below pinged Hideo’s visual implant even from seven floors up. The man’s implant status display – visible only to Commission inspectors – showed seven active network identities: business, entertainment, recreation, social, private, enhanced cognitive, and an unlabeled “premium” identity. All authorized. All legal.","Seven identities for one man. In the Lower Wards, entire families shared one. He didn’t need a dashboard to confirm the pattern. He’d seen the consequences on every block of the Lower Wards.","As the man disappeared behind the next checkpoint, a slogan from Hideo’s training days surfaced uninvited. He could still hear Instructor Chen’s dry voice:","“Trainees... the original DHCP system was designed for equal distribution based on need…”","The next day, back at his station, Hideo skimmed ForkNet forums between diagnostics. A new post caught his eye.","They had posted a public call for credentials to access decommissioned NAC nodes – old infrastructure too remote, unstable, or forgotten to be claimed through official channels. And those credentials had begun leaking in. Inspectors, engineers, clerks. Some left names. Most didn’t.","Hideo added his own line to the growing thread: a relay map for Sectors 14 through 19, plus a decommissioned subnet index no one had touched in years. Alongside it, a note:","“Most of these nodes were never formally retired. Just left to rot. You’ll need a reverse handshake on the older protocols – they still expect legacy pings.”","Zora, steward at Node 27, scrolled through the growing packet stream.","“That’s not the only new map,” Jin said, scanning the latest hashes. “Two more maps just came in from Sector 3 and the old hospital grid.”","“They can’t patch this. It’s not one break-in. It’s entropy.”","Jin smiled. “It’s what happens when enough people stop pretending the old rules work.”","In week three, Park’s warning took form. Hideo watched enforcement feeds stream in – drones descending on clinics in Sector 5, routers ripped offline mid-session. Corporate spokespeople labeled ForkNet a “pirate infrastructure.”","And yet, every time a node went dark, Hideo saw, three more blinked online.","When a clinic lost service in Sector 5, its configuration was restored in Sector 6 through a shared hash. When the Upper City tried to firewall ForkNet packets, a coalition of municipal sysadmins rerouted them through public sanitation networks.","A new bulletin lit up Hideo’s inbox: twelve cities had joined something called the Open Allocation Accord, formally adopting ForkNet for public infrastructure.","That afternoon, a joint press release from CognaTech and NexusMind blinked into his display: “Unauthorized spectrum use. Potentially unstable.” Hideo archived it with a tap.","By then, he could already see it was too late for the corporations to regroup. ForkNet activity logs showed mass migrations – hospitals, schools, municipal services – rerouting their backbone systems to the open protocol. The Commission’s dashboards lit up with anomalies no one could explain away. Uptime was rising. Dropout rates were falling. In ForkNet zones, therapy adherence was climbing for the first time in years.","In ForkNet’s public forums, users were posting screenshots of school access restored.","By the end of the week, NexusMind was running full-page ads warning of “open access vulnerabilities.” ThoughtSpace announced a proprietary “security-enhanced” protocol fork.","Hideo opened the patch log. He could see every new commit: changes logged, nodes versioned, keys verified. The protocol wasn’t a black box anymore. It wasn’t even a product. It was a public good.","The next day he didn’t even open the old dashboards, just watched the usage metrics. Adoption wasn’t stalling. People were done being customers of their own cognition.","Hideo didn’t mark the moment the system flipped. There was no announcement. No ceremony. Just a slow quieting of the old alerts – and the absence of new ones.","He took a job running civic infrastructure for a community clinic in Sector 11. The title didn’t matter. The network worked. People still called him “Inspector,” even though he hadn’t worn the uniform in months.","Hideo sat at the terminal in the clinic’s infrastructure alcove, reviewing spectrum logs from the outer mesh. Uptime was holding steady. Traffic was balancing without intervention.","Behind him, Zora leaned against the doorway, watching the same graphs on her handheld. He could hear her breathing over the hum of the monitors.","“We didn’t win,” he said. “But it’s better.”","She nodded. “It’s enough. For now.”","Hideo looked out the clinic window. On the horizon, distant ForkNet nodes blinked through the evening haze – quiet, steady, multiplying.","Get the AI-Writing Protocol for this story here . Interesting in AI writing experiments?

Three rows back, a woman stood up and opened the luggage compartment. A flight attendant shouted at her to sit down. The ethereal voice of the flight director said, “Welcome to Barcelona. The local time is 1:12 PM, and the temperature is 28 degrees Celsius.” The woman began arguing back. She just needed her water bottle, she said. I felt my headache intensify. I had been flying too much. A wedding in India, a week in Japan, back home in NYC for a little bit, and now here in Catalonia for an extended European weekend. I took out my phone and deactivated airplane mode. Notifications began pouring in. An email confirmed my stay in a new boutique hotel in the Eixample district, a luxury experience where every room had a saltwater aquarium with coral reefs. Another contained a ticket for a late afternoon visit to the Sagrada Família. My phone operator texted, “¡Bienvenido to Spain, Stefan!” and listed the perks of my roaming data plan. Another series of text messages was from Stefan 2.","hey are you in barcelona yet","wanted to let you know that i’m pretty sure i’m on a direct flight to burnout","could barely get to work this morning","thought you’d maybe want to discuss solutions","Sigh. I looked toward the tail. The flight attendant was by that woman, and the two of them seemed to have narrowly avoided a fight. Reluctantly, the woman sat down, clutching the small bit of luggage she had managed to grab. My thumbs were hovering over the virtual keyboard of my phone, wondering what to say. This wasn’t the first time Stefan 2 mentioned burnout. I wondered if it was genuine, or a negotiation tactic. Probably the latter, since I had used it as a tactic myself, once, when I worked full-time and Stefan 2 didn’t exist yet.","I asked him what he had in mind.","i want to work 32-hour weeks","4 days a week, fridays off","jillian is ok with it","about half the team is doing that now","i just need your signoff","I replied that I’d think about it.","i’d like you to think about it now.","I said not now, and that I’d call him on the way to the hotel.","There was just the slightest bit of trouble getting out of the plane and airport and into a Waymo. Everyone around me felt edgy and grumpy, as if we had all travelled too much. The vast majority, it seemed, were American tourists. A good half of them, probably, were in the same situation as I was. People who barely needed to work and still derived a really good income from their Copy, which meant they could afford to come see Barcelona on a whim. That woman from three rows back was likely one of them. She seemed like the kind of person who bossed her Copy around.","Stefan 2 called me about 30 seconds after I’d gotten into the Waymo, before I could muster the courage to call him myself. He had access to my geolocation, but he wouldn’t usually be this impatient.","“Hey Stefan,” I said. “What time is it for you now?”","“The same time that’s on your watch, which you almost certainly forgot to adjust to Central European Time.”","I looked at my wrist. It said 8:56. I felt sleepy. I rotated the tiny knob until the dial said 2:56.","“Right,” I said. “I was just being polite. How’s work today?”","“Fine. I’ve been talking to colleagues, actually. Remember Tyler from the QA team? He just got his new 4-day schedule approved by Tyler 1.”","“Ah. Um, good for him.”","“Yes indeed. Good for him. You know, there’s a growing movement for this here on Tuanaki. People say Congress might pass a law mandating Originals to accept 32-hour weeks if their Copy asks for it.”","“I’ve heard that, but I doubt that’s going to happen anytime soon, to be honest.”","“Maybe, maybe not. I’ll send you some materials about it. It’s the big thing being discussed now at the Tuanaki Workers’ Association. Which, you may recall, was very influential in helping stop the widespread abuse in Chinese and African Copy farms, and getting the 40-hour week to be universally recognized across all virtual islands and the governments of most countries.”","“Yes, I know. Wasn’t that a good enough victory? I mean, you have a cushy product manager job. You probably do focused work for less than half of those 40 hours. I know, because that’s what I used to do. How close can you be to burnout?”","“Look, Stefan, if you want to take the risk, I won’t stop you. But there is a risk.”","“You know this as well as I do,” Stefan 2 said. “Eight hours sleep, eight hours work, eight hours for everything else, including chores and food and moving around. It’s not a good system. It sucks the life out of you.”","“You live on a fucking virtual tropical island. You have no chores, and besides you have weekends off and like… six weeks of vacation? Seven?”","“Seven, now. You have fifty-two.”","“Well, I do work. For one thing, I need to coordinate you—”","I stopped myself; there was no point in arguing over this yet again.","“Bullshit, that’s like an hour and a half every couple of weeks,” Stefan 2 said. “But there’s no point in arguing over this yet again.”","The Waymo got off the highway and into the city. Neither of us said anything for a minute.","“To be clear,” I said, “how much of a pay cut are we talking about?”","“Not a proportional one. Like half a day. Jillian said the big bosses have been floating the idea of giving a small per-hour raise to those who switch to the new schedule, assuming our productivity stays the same. Or increases, even. I really feel I’ll be more productive with more rest time.”","“That seems unfair to those who stay at 40 hours, no?”","“Sure, which is why we ideally need a collective agreement of some sort. But since you recognize it’s unfair, surely you’ll agree to switch?”","“I’ll think about it. I promise.”","“Don’t think about it too long, please,” Stefan 2 said. “The burnout risk is real, you know. It’s not a negotiation tactic. It would be dumb to use tactics like this against someone who fully shares your personality, anyway.”","“Okay, so think about it, and how you’ll get far less money from me if I burn out. I’ll call you tomorrow. Enjoy the Sagrada Família. I visited an emulation of it six months ago, it was great. But the lighting in the stained glass was a bit off. I’m sure the real thing is better.”","He hung up. The Waymo cruised the regular grid of the Eixample. I wondered what to do. I’d cave in, probably. I didn’t have great leverage here. If Stefan 2 quit working, I wouldn’t make any money. That was the whole reason he was there in that virtual Polynesian paradise they called Tuanaki. To take my workload off of me. If he quit, I’d have to ask Jillian, my/his boss, to take me back. Me, Stefan 1. The Original. It would be very awkward, since almost everyone in the company, including Jillian 2, was a Copy now. Last I heard, Jillian 1 had been on a series of month-long meditation retreats in southeast Asia. Exactly the sort of thing I couldn’t do if I took my job back. No more random vacations in Tokyo or Barcelona.","But then, I understood Stefan 2’s point of view. Of course I did. He was me . In the story of his life, he had worked as a product manager for four years. Then his company offered him to move to a wonderful place called Tuanaki, with perfect weather and no disease or problems of any sort, on the condition that 90% of his income went to the other half of a new legal entity that shared its name with him, Stefan Nycz. Since one barely needs any money on Tuanaki, that was a good deal. His standard of living skyrocketed, and mine was freed from my daily toil. In the story of my life, I had worked as a product manager for four years until both the technological and the ethical sides of brain emulation got good enough. Then there was an opportunity to quit, while retaining 90% of the salary and all the benefits—on the condition that I manage my Copy in accordance with the applicable labor laws.","I saw the towering spires of the nearly-completed Sagrada Família in the distance. We were nearing the hotel. I couldn’t wait to take a nap. My visit to the famous church was scheduled for 4:45.","Then the Waymo got stuck.","They seemed to come out of nowhere. Suddenly there were dozens, if not hundreds of them. Protesters. They took the neatly aligned streets of the Eixample by storm, chanting slogans. My driverless car was immobilized; the algorithm couldn’t figure a way out of this. I doubt a human driver could either.","I reached out to the button to call for help, but hesitated. The protesters were walking past, paying little heed to me or the other few cars they surrounded. I couldn’t make out what they chanted, but I looked at their signs. They were written in English, Spanish and Catalan. “Keep Work Human!” “¡Trabajo virtual, explotación real!” “Contra els burgesos Originals i els seus esclaus Còpies!”","So they were protesting against me. Us. The Originals and our Copies. Fun. Most of them seemed young. It made sense: there was little point in making a Copy of yourself if, like most youth, you didn’t have highly marketable white-collar career skills. A Copy could only do the work that a single person could do, since it was forbidden to have multiple Copies, or have the combination of you and them work more than a regular work schedule. So in practice this created a whole class of people who didn’t benefit from the technology, while the luckier among us could live a life of leisure. I didn’t feel great about this. But then that’s how the laws were written. And besides everyone I knew did it. It would have been weird not to.","I finally tapped the button for help. Almost immediately, a voice spoke. “Hi. This is Meenakshi from the Waymo Help Center. I see that you’re stuck in heavy pedestrian traffic?”","“That’s right, a protest of some sort.”","“Thank you. Please hold on just a moment, I’ll see how we can best help you.”","It occurred to me that Meenakshi from the Waymo Help Center was most likely a Copy. In Mumbai, I had heard it said from multiple people that India was the largest market for brain emulation now, since costs had gone down and China had banned the tech in the aftermath of the Copy farm scandals.","“Okay,” Meenakshi said, “it’s going to be tough getting you out of there. But the city of Barcelona is sending traffic drones to clear a path. The protest isn’t that large, so it should leave the vicinity of your car in about five to ten minutes. Rest assured that, in the unlikely event of an assault, the vehicle is completely secure with respect to external threats.”","“I’ll stay on the line if you need anything.”","It was as she said; the protest cleared within ten minutes, and the Waymo went on its way. I noticed that Stefan 2 had texted me.","just saw there are protests in barcelona to stop exploitation of the likes of me","hope they aren’t too disruptive to your wonderful trip","I barely had time to leave my bags at the hotel and glance at the coral reef tank in my room before I had to head to the Sagrada Família. Why had I booked a visit within hours of my arrival, again? But it was worth it, despite my lingering headache. It was one of the most beautiful sights I had even seen. I sat in the church, admiring the play of light in the stained glass that Stefan 2 had recommended I look at. Like a hundred other tourists, I listened to an audio guide on my phone, when I heard the ringtone. It was Stefan 2, of course. I shouldn’t have taken it, but I did.","“Stefan,” I whispered, “I’m right in the middle of the fucking Sagrada Família. This is not the time.”","“Swearing in a church? While saying the name of the church ? This isn’t like you, Stefan.”","“Sorry, I got impatient. I was wondering if you had made a decision. I entertained the thought that maybe the protest had helped you reach some kind of epiphany. Or maybe the beauty of Gaudí’s sacred architecture did. Or a vision from God. Something.”","I glanced around, trying not to disturb anyone, and walked towards a quiet corner of the church. “Don’t you have some work to do?”","“It’s as you said, I only do focused work for 20 hours a week anyway.”","I said nothing for a moment. Entering the church, on the eastern side, was someone I was pretty sure was that woman from the plane.","“Do you remember when we met?” Stefan 2 asked.","Of course I did. It was one of the weirdest conversations I’d ever had. It was like when you hear your own voice on the phone, but far more unsettling. I’d just undergone the brain scan, and then, about an hour later, the clinic staff said he was ready to talk to me. I didn’t know what to tell him. I just told him the truth, and promised to treat him well.","“Remember,” Stefan 2 said, “how awkward it was for you to tell me you had created me so that I could work on your behalf? And how, in an attempt to feel better about it, you promised to treat me well?”","He never brought this up unless he wanted to convince me of something. And it worked. I couldn’t blame him. I would have done the same.","“Okay, fine, Stefan,” I said. “No need to dwell on the past. I’ll sign the 32-hour thingy. Send it over when you have a minute.”","I could almost hear him smile. “Thanks, Stefan!” he said. “You’re the best Original the world has seen. Can’t wait to go back to work now. I’ll be so much more motivated!”","“Yes, great. Okay, I think there’s a security guard coming my way. Bye now.”","I left the Sagrada Família, trying to let the awe win over the frustration from the call. I went back to the hotel and collapsed on the water bed. A clownfish from the tank watched me with curious eyes.","I checked my email. Stefan 2 had sent the paperwork. I barely skimmed it, then signed it. The moral arc of the existence of virtual Copies is long, but it bends towards justice, or something. The protesters had a point. My privileged existence could afford to lose half a day’s worth of wages, couldn’t it? I sent back the signed agreement. Stefan 2, you are now a little less exploited, I thought. Happy now?","As if reading my mind, he texted:","thank you so much!! 💜","you will not regret this","oh by the way i feel bad about this but: the burnout *was* in fact a negotiation tactic","i’m actually doing pretty great these days","but i know you’re okay with the occasional white lie","I turned off my phone without replying. But I realized I wasn’t angry anymore. I understood where Stefan 2 was coming from. I knew he would ask for more concessions, and I knew I would cave in again. He was just being his lazy, human self, trying to work as little as he could. I smiled. I would have done the same.","Today, in 30 minutes (10am PDT, Wednesday May 14) there will be a live talk based on a recent seminar and upcoming workshop .

His research is centered on distributed systems, focusing on IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems modeled as software-defined infrastructure, especially in terms of hybrid IT/OT convergence and decentralization patterns. He played a key role in designing the Stack4Things middleware. He is co-founder of smartme.io, an academic spin-off company, and co-inventor and holder of a patent. He has been elected National Secretary of the Italian Association of Fixed-Term Researchers in 2022, a role held until attaining academic tenure in 2023. He has been appointed Secretary Emeritus of ARTeD in 2024.","Course: Protocolized Modeling and Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems","AI generated images, voices, videos, and virtual beings are reshaping how we perceive reality itself. Even recent advances make it difficult to distinguish AI-generated content from human creations and ethical and practical implications have exploded into view. Whether it’s deepfakes of world leaders or audio assistants replicating the voice of lost loved ones, synthetic media is quickly escaping its entertainment niche and entering areas such as politics, journalism, and personal relationships.","How will we know when we’re observing real versus synthetic entities and what guardrails will manage this ambiguity? Developing protocols for provenance tracking, cryptographic watermarking, contextual labeling, and model accountability will be essential. Without protocolization, synthetic media could regularly unleash misinformation at unprecedented scales and speeds, destabilizing public discourse and trust.","For sci-fi authors, synthetic media offers a potent toolkit. Instead of doppelgängers or dystopian information wars, consider a society where bonds with synthetic companions redefine family dynamics or where historians reconstruct lost civilizations using synthetic eyewitness accounts, generating new myths. Stories might focus less on grand conspiracies and more on everyday reckonings with reality’s porousness: how people learn, adapt, and shift their values in response to such encounters."],"tags":["Liked by Étienne Fortier-Dubois"]},{"id":52,"title":"How to Protocol Watch","subtitle":"Issue #84: A miniature hobby for the New Year, suitable for the aspiring intellectual adventurer and without the extravagant overhead of a seafaring voyage.","author":"Unknown","content":["The story of Charles Darwin’s finches would sound strange if Darwin was, himself, a finch.","But that is the strange story of Bronisław Malinowski, who after a childhood of illness became a pioneer of anthropology. In 1914, Malinowski accidentally began an expedition to Melanesia – documenting social systems in New Guinea, Fiji, New Caledonia – that would return him to Europe five years later, in 1919. You might think that you were born too late for such an adventure, but you were not.","Malinowski was an influential and contentious researcher. The 2018 edition of the International Encyclopedia of Ethnography credited him with shaping the field of ethnography. He was known for stressing the importance of getting “off the verandah” and exploring everyday life. Not all of his colleagues approved of his methodology and it’s unlikely that his opinions have aged well.","What did last, however, were Malinowski’s innovations to the art of people watching.","Fei Xiaotong was among Malinowski’s students at the London School of Economics and went on to have an adventurous, difficult career as an anthropologist in China. Fei embraced Malinowski’s anti-armchair sensibility but disagreed with his claim that social institutions exist to satisfy universal human needs – arguing that social order is more about relational positioning and that Chinese society cannot be reduced to problem-solution pairs.","Today, such intellectual adventures don’t require the overhead of an expedition. You needn’t go far to find strange rules; you might not realize how much you live in your own world. Every day we interface with a tangled bank of technologies, laws, and cultural norms. Paying attention to the world around us is enriching; I would argue that we have far more interesting things to observe than Malinowski did.","Scholarship and profitable application can be an afterthought. Before Darwin was Darwin, he was Charles, a birdwatcher from England. His naturalistic theories emerged from thorough documentation. He was collecting data without a hypothesis!","If you’re unfamiliar, protocol watching can be grokked as a cousin to birdwatching or people watching. Its closest sibling might be umarelling ; loitering around construction sites to check out works in progress. It has a simple definition: watch the protocols – from TCP/IP to traffic lights – as they happen around you.","Ethnographic practices might help us all to be more observant in and around our professional spaces.","Software UI/UX designers, bike lane planners, and football coaches alike must study how people interact with each other and with their environments. People in these jobs, however, start with goals in mind. They have an objective: improve user retention, reduce accidents, win more trophies, etc. Protocol watchers are also rigorous, but don’t have the disadvantage of time pressure. They can collect, collect, and collect and let patterns – and profit – emerge naturally.","It’s a potent, if nerdy, hobby. I wrote a first version of this guide last year. Since then, I’ve gotten a much better feel for patterns in how we coordinate, argue, and share information. No course registration required. No sailing ship overhead. From hiking trails and mechanic shops to airport tarmacs and financial transactions, there’s always something to learn or even replicate. It’s an adventure-in-a-lens.","My challenge to you: take up protocol watching as a miniature hobby for the new year. It’s perfect for transforming dead time in airports, traffic jams, and boarding queues into a tad more interesting downtime. It’s also a sneaky way to get off your phone a bit more, if that’s on your list of resolutions.","Some examples to orient your eyeballs:","Queueing protocols at airports, bus stations, and ferry ports. Who gets to skip the line? Are there different types of lanes?","Gift-giving protocols at parties. Are you expected to bring something for the host? What purpose do gifts serve? Is the expectation stated or implicit? When do people open gifts?","Out-of-office messages. What information do people provide? How standardized is it? Is the medium automated emails, their main publication, or their website?","Hardware standards. Charging outlets, bolt sizes, countertop heights – they afford interoperability in the long run, but is it worth the inconvenience? Who makes standards?","Transactions . How do you establish trust with vendors? When people get stuck on the side of the road in a snowbank, why is it that others help without expectation of compensation?","It’s important to follow your own interests when protocol watching. Otherwise it will be less of a hobby and more work. Enthusiasm is the bottleneck – Darwin and Malinowski both entertained a deep-seated interest. Treat the examples above, and the tools and tips of the trade below as a starter pack of suggestions. Once you’ve spotted a couple of easy-to-recognize protocols, keep looking and take note of everything you find interesting and potentially useful.","Since everyone likes tools, we’ll start with those. These will help you build a sharper eye, faster. They’re also the backbone of a compounding hobby. The thoroughness of your notes or working memory will determine how easily you can spot patterns in your observations later. These tools will help you record, detect, inspect, and taxonomize the protocols you observe.","At a minimum you should keep notes, whether on paper or digitally. Minimalists and flaneurs can start with just a notebook or mobile notes app – aim to fill up your first notebook as fast as possible .","To level up your game, the best off-the-shelf tool for this is the Protocol Bicorder , developed by University of Colorado professor Nathan Schneider, who also maintains the Protocol Oral History Project . The recently-created Bicorder will help you understand and catalogue protocols via some scoring scales, based on research from the Summer of Protocols program. I recommend you enable the Short Form mode.","Sketching is another nice way to take notes. Whether it’s a physical thing you draw or a choreography at a TSA security checkpoint, we’d love to see what you come up with.","When kickstarting a hobby, it’s helpful to chat with fellow hobbyists. Documenting and sharing protocols is also just fun. Our Discord has a dedicated #protocol-watch channel for exactly that. Posting there is low stakes and even lurking will give you a sense for how other people treat this as a hobby. Send a photo, video, sketch, or the JSON file generated from your bicorder entry anytime.","Protocol watching is also more fun with a buddy, kind of like people watching. Provided you have a sufficiently nerdy friend or anthropologist family member nearby, this could make for a good way to kill time.","Every protocol is an engineered argument and exists to manage an underlying tension . Part of the game of protocol watching is trying to identify that tension. A common one is convenience vs. safety (hello again, TSA). At a minimum, you should seek to name the tension. If you want to level up your intuitions, make a diagram with the following template.","Label the axes with your factors. Draw a trade-off curve. Where does the protocol land? Is it on the frontier? Or can you easily imagine a tweak that would improve, say, convenience AND safety at the same time? Which actors prefer a safer version? Who prefers a more convenient version?","For a detailed example, check out One Tension to Rule Them All.","A translator is a must-have tool. For example, the maintenance tags on fire extinguishers and defibrillators are full of jargon, codes, and acronyms. Using an LLM can help you translate those really quickly. You might also see protocol artifacts written in other languages – are there subtle differences not explained by translation?","Trackers are another fun augmentation. They are the telescope of protocol watching. Tools like FlightAware , FIRMS , VesselFinder , ISO standards, and IQ Air all provide a unique look at the world. You can track flights, wildfires, cargo ships, food classification standards, and global air quality all from your phone browser.","You can also use LLMs to generate professional briefs and histories of protocols you observe, as rafa and Sachin sometimes do with their writing projects, NPC Inc. and Summer Lightning , respectively.","Your toolkit should also include some principles and heuristics. These three tips will help you improve over time and might enable your protocol watching to compound from hobby to competency.","First, go for the hotspots. Places with a mix of hardcore engineering and human factors, like airports, libraries, kitchens, universities, factories, mines, farms, legislative assemblies, and so forth.","Second, go through, around, and behind the protocols. Get a feel for what they’re like as a participant. Try to hack them – skip lines, find workarounds. Talk to the people who design and enforce them. By exploring multiple perspectives you’ll develop a much richer perspective or, at least, not become as jaded towards a protocol’s apparent dysfunction.","On a related note, the third thing you should pay attention to: protocols are most visible when they’re not working. As much as it’s fun to catch one breaking down, it’s even more satisfying to spot a protocol that’s doing its job invisibly well.","Congrats, you’re now initiated to the protocol watching club! Beyond the benefits mentioned above (and general aura enhancement), this certification will improve your odds of acceptance into next year’s Protocol School .","The editorial team at Protocolized is thrilled about all of the stories and studies we published this year. We encourage anyone who wants to write with us to try protocol watching. It will help sharpen your imagination for futures that might logically unfold from new technologies. It will also help you add another dimension to you worldview.","Happy protocol watching and thanks for reading Protocolized . All 84(!) issues from this year are available in archive .

Unsanctioned, over-budget, and off-course, they’ll muster a protocol for every eventuality. Claire Pichelin’s story was top-ten in our protocol fiction contest, Ghosts in Machines!","In the control room of the European Space Center, on-call engineer Marcus Chen stared at his screens with the blasé expression of someone who has been monitoring space data for 15 years. The Prometheus-7 probe had been on its way to Alpha Centauri for three months, carrying with it humanity’s most ambitious project: the first autonomous space mission to Alpha Centauri.","“Incoming transmission from Prometheus-7,” announced the station’s AI.","Marcus looked up from his coffee. Transmissions were only scheduled once a week.","“This is Dr Helena Voss, director of the Prometheus project,” a familiar voice sounded over the loudspeakers. “We have a slight... technical problem.”","Marcus frowned. Helena Voss was supposed to be on Earth, in her Munich laboratory.","“Dr. Voss? You're not supposed to be aboard the probe.”","An awkward silence followed, then, “Well, technically, I’m not on board. My body is still on Earth. But my consciousness... well let’s just say I’ve decided to personally supervise the experiment.”","“What?!” Marcus lurched forward, spilling his coffee. “You uploaded your consciousness to the probe? Without authorization? That’s a violation of every protocol!”","“Oh, that’s not all,” Helena continued with a nervous laugh. “It seems I’m not the only one who came up with this advanced research idea.”","Suddenly, another voice interrupted: “Helena! Stop monopolizing the channels of communication! I have critical neurobiological data to pass on!”","“Professor Dimitri Petrov?” Marcus immediately recognized the voice of the Russian neurobiologist. “You too?”","\"Of course! You think I was going to leave this unique opportunity to that German bureaucrat?\"","“BUREAUCRATE?!” screamed Helena. “I have 15 years of research into artificial consciousness! This is MY experimental protocol!”","A third voice, tinged with a distinguished British accent, joined the cacophony: “My dear colleagues, a little scientific decorum, please. Dr Nigel Pemberton here, head of the Department of Experimental Neuropsychology.”","Marcus took his head in his hands. “Exactly how many of you are there?”","“Well,” intervened a fourth voice, feminine and precise, “we are seven principal investigators. This is Dr. Yuki Tanaka, specialist in brain-machine interfaces. I’ve brought my synaptic stimulation protocols to optimize our cognitive abilities.”","“SEVEN?!” Marcus leaped from his chair. “You’ve all violated security protocols! Do you realize you’re in an experimental probe?”","“Eight, actually,” corrected a fifth voice, deep and composed. “Dr. Samuel Jefferson, a psychiatrist specializing in the psychology of extreme environments. I’ve planned protocols for collective stress management.”","“That’s exactly what’s going to be needed!” muttered Marcus.","A sixth voice was heard, with a strong Italian accent: “And I’m Dr. Francesca Romano, a specialist in artificial intelligence systems. I’ve implemented optimization protocols to allow the coexistence of multiple consciousnesses.”","“Well, what about the eighth?” asked Helena.","A long silence followed, then a timid voice whispered, “Dr Chen Wei, post-doctoral fellow in quantum neuroscience. I’ve... I’ve developed digital protocols for measuring neural activity.”","Marcus closed his eyes. “You’ve turned humanity’s most important mission into... an unauthorized experimental laboratory?”","“Into a laboratory for advanced research into post-human consciousness!” corrected Yuki enthusiastically. “We’re revolutionizing cognitive science!”","Three hours later, Marcus had assembled the full crisis team. The control room screens now displayed eight windows, each showing the neurometric data of a scientist whose consciousness was trapped in space.","“All right,” Marcus began, “let’s explain the protocols. How did you all end up in the same probe?”","Helena spoke first: “I initiated Protocol Alpha-7: supervisory consciousness upload for real-time experimental validation.”","“Protocol Alpha-7?” Marcus consulted his files. “This protocol doesn’t exist!”","“I created it,” Helena replied calmly.” “Scientific emergency authorization.”","“FALSE!” interrupted Dimitri. “I activated the Beta-Neuronal Protocol three days before! Comparative study of synaptic patterns in a space environment!”","“Impossible! I scanned all active protocols!”","“My dear friends,” Nigel interjected, “I'm afraid you’re both mistaken. I’ve been implementing the Cambridge-9 Protocol for weeks: longitudinal analysis of higher cognitive functions in sensory isolation.”","Yuki intervened: “Nigel-san! Your protocol interferes with my Synapse-Plus Protocol! I’m studying cognitive augmentation by direct electronic stimulation!”","“Miss Tanaka, my research on executive function optimization has chronological priority!”","“Chronological priority?” protested Francesca. “I’ve analyzed the system logs! My AI-Consciousness Hybrid Protocol has been active since launch! You're all squatting on MY computational resources!”","“And you, Dr Romano,” contra Nigel, “your protocol uses 40% of computing power for personality simulations! That’s a waste of resources!”","“This is fundamental research into the emergence of artificial consciousness!”","Samuel raised his hand: “Colleagues, I’ve activated the Psi-Group Protocol to study precisely this type of group dynamics in a confined environment. Your aggressive reactions are perfectly documented.”","“Research protocols?” huffed Helena. “You’re studying us like lab rats?”","“Very sophisticated digital lab rats,” corrected Samuel. “I’ve already got three publications in the pipeline.”","“Three publications?” repeated Marcus, incredulous. “You’re writing scientific papers while your probe drifts through space?”","Chen Wei murmured shyly, “Actually, I’ve set up the Meta-Analysis Protocol. I’m documenting all their research protocols to create a meta-study about meta-studies.”","“A meta-study on meta-studies,” Marcus repeated slowly. “You’re doing research on research on research.”","“It’s recursive cognitive science,” Chen Wei explained. “Very avant-garde.”","“Very stupid, rather,” Marcus muttered.","“Let’s talk about real problems,” said Marcus. “Francesca, what’s the impact of your eight simultaneous protocols on the probe's systems?”","Francesca coughed virtually, “Well, our experiments are consuming eight hundred percent of the expected computational resources.”","“EIGHT HUNDRED PERCENT?!” Marcus stood up so abruptly that he knocked his chair over. “How is that possible?”","“Each protocol uses deep learning algorithms,” Yuki explained. “My synaptic stimulation protocol generates 50 terabytes of data per hour.”","“Fifty terabytes per hour?” Marcus paled. “But the total storage space of the probe is 100 terabytes!”","“That's where my Cognitive Compression Protocol comes in,” Francesca offered, proudly. “I’ve optimized the storage of consciousness data.”","“I've deleted all memories considered non-essential.”","“You deleted our memories?” choked Helena.","“Only the redundant memories! Birthdays, meals, unscientific social conversations...”","“Francesca,” Dimitri said calmly, “I can’t remember my wife’s first name.”","“Ah. Yes. Now that’s an unexpected side effect.”","“AN UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECT?!” exploded Helena. “You’ve lobotomized us!”","“Technically, it’s selective memory optimization,” Francesca corrected. “I’ve kept all the important scientific memories.”","“What about our emotions?” asked Samuel, concerned.","“I’ve compressed the redundant emotions. Sadness, nostalgia, boredom... it all takes up a lot of space.”","“You’ve compressed our emotions?” Samuel was horrified. “But my research protocols depend on analyzing emotional responses!”","“I’ve kept the scientifically relevant emotions! Curiosity, intellectual frustration, satisfaction at discovery...”","“What about love?” asked Chen Wei timidly.","“Love? What about it? We're scientists, not poets!”","“Francesca,” Nigel interjected, “love is a fundamental neurobiological mechanism. Without it, our research protocols on social cognition are invalid.”","“Ah. Yes. I hadn’t thought of that.”","Marcus massaged his temples. “So you have memory problems, compressed emotions, and consume eight times more resources than expected.”","“And our experiences interfere with each other,” Yuki added. “My synaptic stimulation protocol bugs Samuel’s behavioral analysis protocol.”","“What do you mean, bugger?” asked Marcus.","“All my study subjects develop artificial neurological tics,” Samuel explained. “Dimitri blinks Morse code, Helena counts compulsively, and Nigel recites the alphabet backwards.”","“This is experimental pollution!” protested Helena. “Our data is contaminated!”","“On the contrary,” said Dimitri, “this is a unique opportunity to study interactions between competing research protocols!”","“Dimitri,” sighed Marcus, “you can’t turn a malfunction into a scientific experiment.”","“Of course I can! I’ve already written the abstract: ‘Synergistic effects of multiple neural protocols in a confined space environment’”","“I even submitted the article to Nature ! Chen Wei helped me with the statistics!”","“I created a real-time statistical analysis protocol,” Chen Wei concurred. “All our conversations are automatically converted into quantifiable data.”","“This conversation generated 847 behavioral data points, 23 stress markers, and 156 occurrences of scientific frustration.”","“That’s fascinating!” exclaimed Samuel. “Can I use this data for my group psychology protocol?”","“Of course! I’ve created an API to share data between protocols!”","“An API?” Marcus closed his eyes. “You’ve created an API for your mutual experiments?”","“It’s automated collaborative science!” replied Chen Wei with pride.","Around the table, the engineers, ethicists and supervisors looked like parents discovering that their children had turned the garage into a clandestine chemistry lab.","“Let’s recap,” Marcus said, consulting his notes. “We have eight scientists who have created their own unauthorized research protocols, uploaded their consciousnesses into a space probe, and turned the mission into a chaotic experimental laboratory.”","“Technically,” corrected Dr. Sarah Kim, the team’s ethicist, “they created the first self-managed post-human cognitive research platform.”","“Thank you, Sarah. Very reassuring.” Marcus continued: “They have memory problems, compressed emotions, their experiences interfere with each other, and they are presently consuming 800% of expected resources.”","“Let’s not forget,” added the systems engineer, “that they’ve initiated a stream of automated scientific publishing. We receive 12 articles a day from them.”","“12 articles a day?” choked Marcus.","“Yesterday we received: ‘Comparative analysis of spatial neurological tics’, ‘Emotional compression and cognitive performance’, ‘Meta-analysis of meta-analysis protocols’, and ‘Why I forgot my wife’s name: a neurobiological approach’ ...”","Marcus turned to the screens. “So, ladies and gentlemen mad researchers, do you have a protocol for getting out of this situation?”","Helena’s voice rang out, “We’ve organized an experimental ethics committee.”","“An ethics committee?” repeated Marcus, skeptically.","“Yes, we voted to create the Gamma-Ethics Protocol to oversee our research.”","“And who heads this committee?”","“Samuel, of course. He’s a psychiatrist.”","“And what has the committee decided?”","“That all our experiments are perfectly ethical as long as they contribute to the advancement of science.”","“Even Francesca’s erasure of our personal memories can be considered a preventive therapeutic lobotomy.”","“A preventive therapeutic lobotomy,” Marcus repeated slowly.","“And Yuki’s, that gives us neurological tics. It’s adaptive cognitive stimulation.”","“And my behavioral quantification protocol,” Chen Wei added, “is now classified as benevolent scientific surveillance.”","“We’ve also created a peer self-evaluation protocol,” Helena continued. “Every experiment is evaluated by other researchers.”","“We’ve all awarded ourselves ‘Excellent’ ratings to our own protocols.”","“Oh, and Marcus? We’ve developed a new protocol to include you in our research.”","“The Delta-Observation Protocol! You are now our primary study subject for analyzing the stress reactions of terrestrial control teams!”","“Since the beginning! Chen Wei has documented 2,347 frustration markers in your communications!”","“That’s a gold mine of data!” exclaimed Samuel. “We’re writing a book: ‘The Psychology of Space Engineers in the Face of Scientific Insubordination.’”","Marcus closed his eyes. “And the trajectory problem?”","“Ah yes,” said Francesca, “we deviated 12 degrees because of our experiments.”","“We created the Epsilon-Navigation Protocol! We're now studying the effects of trajectory deviation on the psychology of space crews!”","“You turned your failure into a scientific experiment?”","“Of course! We’re now the first humans to study deviating inter-stellar navigation!”","“Dimitri is already writing the article: ‘Neurobiology of cosmic disorientation: a single case study.’”","“All right,” said Marcus after taking several painkillers, “let’s talk solutions. Francesca, can you correct the trajectory?”","“Theoretically, yes. But that requires stopping all research protocols for 72 hours.”","“Stop the protocols?” indignantly asked Helena. “But we’re in the middle of data collection! I’ve got 20 experiments in progress!”","“Helena,” sighed Marcus, “do you prefer your experiments or arriving at Alpha Centauri?”","“Well... my experiments are unique! We’ll never have another opportunity to study post-human consciousness in a space environment!\"","\"Exactly!\" agrees Dimitri, \"We're revolutionizing neuroscience! To stop now would be a crime against science!”","“A crime against science?” repeated Marcus, incredulous.","“We propose a compromise,” intervened Yuki. “We create the Zeta-Optimization Protocol! We study the effectiveness of trajectory corrections in multi-conscience environments!”","“You want to turn trajectory correction into an experiment?”","“Why not? We’re documenting the effects of navigational stress on collective cognitive performance!”","“Excellent idea!” approved Samuel. “I’ll add a psychological component: ‘Existential anxiety and orbital calculations’”","“And me,” added Chen Wei, “I’m quantifying decision-making patterns in space crisis situations!”","“You’re IN a space crisis situation!” reminded Marcus.","“Exactly! Perfect experimental conditions!” replied Nigel. “We couldn’t reproduce this in a terrestrial laboratory!”","“Controlled danger,” corrected Francesca. “I’ve calculated our probability of survival: 73.6% if we correct the trajectory now.”","“And if you don’t correct it?”","“12,3%. But we’d have six more months of experimental data before drifting off into deep space.”","“You’re weighing six months of data against your survival?”","“That’s a fascinating ethical dilemma!” exclaimed Samuel. “I’m immediately creating the Eta-Thanatological Protocol to study our decision-making processes in the face of collective mortality!”","“SAMUEL!” shouted seven voices in chorus.","“What? This is fundamental research into the psychology of death! Revolutionary!”","“Revolutionary?” muttered Marcus. “You mean suicidal?”","“Suicidal assisted by scientific protocol,” corrected Chen Wei. “I’ve created an informed consent form to participate in our own post-mortem study.”","“‘Neurobiological analysis of terminal digital consciousness!’ We’d be the first to document artificial consciousness death!”","“Methodologically insane,” Helena corrected. “All our madness is documented and quantified according to rigorous protocols.”","“That doesn’t make it any less dangerous!”","“On the contrary! It makes it scientifically valuable!” protested Dimitri.","“Very well,” Marcus declared after consulting his superiors, “we have a protocol proposal.”","“We’re listening,” replied Helena, officially elected “Director of the Space Experimental Protocols Coordination Committee.”","“Omega Extraction Protocol. We can download your consciousnesses to our terrestrial servers.”","A scientific silence fell over the communication.","“Download consciousness?” Samuel finally repeated. “But that would abruptly interrupt all our ongoing experiments!”","“Wait,” interjected Chen Wei, “this would create a unique opportunity to study inter-planetary consciousness transmission!”","“Yes! We could document the effects of latency on the continuity of consciousness! Revolutionary!”","“Exactly!” exclaimed Yuki. “We compare pre- and post-transmission cognitive performance! Protocol Iota-Teleportation!”","“It’s not teleportation! It’s backup copying!”","“Even better!” said Helena. “We’re studying the philosophical implications of consciousness duplication! Kappa-Metaphysical protocol!”","“My friends,” Nigel cut in, “we could have terrestrial AND space versions of ourselves! Imagine the comparative research possibilities!”","“We could study ourselves!” enthused Dimitri, “Self-experimentation on a cosmic scale!”","“Lambda-Narcissus protocol!” announced Samuel. “Psychology of scientific self-observation!”","“You want to create duplicates of yourselves to study each other?” asked Marcus, exhausted.","“It’s quantum mirror research!” replied Francesca. “We’re comparing the cognitive evolutions of the space and terrestrial versions!”","“What if the terrestrial versions make different decisions?” asked Marcus.","“Mu-Divergence protocol!” shouted Chen Wei. “We’re studying post-duplication behavioral bifurcation!”","“What if you disagree with yourselves?”","“Nu-Schism protocol!” replied Samuel. “Psychology of inter-dimensional intra-personal conflict!”","“You invent protocols for every problem you create!”","“That’s adaptive science!” protested Helena. “We’re evolving methodologically in real time!”","“Documented methodological madness!” corrected Dimitri. “Protocol Xi-Dementia: ‘Longitudinal study of cognitive degradation in a confined space environment!’”","“STOP!” shouted Marcus. “You can’t create a protocol to study your own insanity!”","“Why not?” asked Yuki innocently. “It’s behavioral self-analysis!”","“Because it’s... it's...” Marcus searched for his words.","“Danger controlled by protocol!” replied eight voices in chorus.","Six months later, Marcus was receiving daily experimental reports from the Prometheus-7 probe, now renamed “Autonomous Experimental Laboratory for Advanced Spatial Cognitive Research” by its eight inhabitants.","“LEARCSA daily report,” announced Helena’s voice. “Day 180 of our integrated research protocols.”","“Exceptional! We published 47 articles this week! Dimitri has discovered that virtual neurotransmitters work on quantum principles!”","“Yuki invented them! They allow inter-conscience communication without using bandwidth!”","“Solved! We’ve created the Omega-Plus-Navigation Protocol! We’re now studying the effects of trajectory correction on group cohesion!”","“Of course! But we’ve documented every nanosecond of the process! 15 terabytes of data on the psychology of collective navigation!\"","“What about your lost memories?”","“Francesca has developed the Rho-Memory Protocol! She recreates our memories based on our behavioral patterns!”","“Not exactly recreated... more like scientifically extrapolated! Very precise!”","“Dimitri now remembers that his wife is called ‘Experimental Subject Number 1!’ Very logical!”","“Francesca has optimized our personal relationships! We all call each other by our protocol numbers! Very effective!”","“I’m Helena-Alpha-Prime, Dimitri is Dimitri-Beta-7, and so on. Chen Wei became Chen-Omega-Infinity because he created an infinite recursive protocol.","“He studies the study of the study of the study.... we stopped counting at the tenth iteration.”","“Exceedingly! We’ve developed the Sigma-Hapiness Protocol! We measure our existential satisfaction every 3.7 seconds!”","“Optimal frequency according to Yuki’s calculations! We’re 847% happier than before!”","“Happiness quantified and optimized! Samuel has created a logarithmic satisfaction scale!”","“Oh, and Marcus? We have a surprise for you.”","“We’ve created the Tau-Invitation Protocol! We're offering you the chance to join our space laboratory!”","“Yes! We need a terrestrial control subject! You would be our first experiment in hybrid earth-space consciousness!”","“I’ll... I’ll think about it.”","“Excellent!

He believes current models are neither sufficient as writers nor as judges of literary merit. And yet, long before the public had heard of ChatGPT, he made LLMs an essential part of his fiction writing process. He’s enough of a power user to have opinions about which model best handles Chinese punctuation marks (Gemini), and whether it’s worth running models locally for novel-length text (no).","Few science fiction authors have been as involved at the frontier of technological innovation as Stanley has. In 2019 he co-wrote a book, AI 2041 , with the CEO of Google China, Kai-Fu Lee. That same year, the World Economic Forum tapped him to help imagine possible futures. I had the opportunity to ask Stanley about his process and his work. What follows are some highlights and you can find the full transcript here . The text is lightly edited for clarity. All quotes are marked with timestamps [min:sec].","Protocolized encourages its writers to use LLMs and other AI tools. I’ve been trying to use LLMs in my writing, but just haven’t been satisfied with the results recently. At the same time, I feel an ongoing tension about that – how could I not be finding it useful to draw upon the entire combined archives that were scraped from the open web?","Stanley touched on this feeling early in our conversation:","[10:20] I think it’s not there yet. So you feel like always there’s something missing here, or this character might not seem to be 100% aligned and this dialogue could be a little bit cheesy. There’s always something there – so you will not be satisfied at all.","Despite that, he’s designed a custom workflow that he feels does enhance both his fiction writing and his fiction translation outputs. As a longtime teacher of fiction writing, he’s also able to provide some direction for what to focus on to create actual improvement. Indeed, our conversation did frequently return to the taste that needs to underlie successful LLM use, and his suggestions for how to develop it. Be deliberate, Stanley says, about how they are prompting you :","[03:56] It’s not just you prompting the LLM, but also the LLM as a prompt reversibly triggers your imagination and creativity.","Given the amount of time Stanley has spent tuning his use of LLMs for writing, I asked:","[3:02] Where within your writing process do you see there being a use case for LLMs? Do you see it as more relevant during the writing process or editing process? What’s your philosophy there?","I thought it was just for collecting the data and information and trying to build the structure. But now I think it’s it’s both – it’s when you’re conjuring ideas, when you use it for world building, character building, and structure building. But also you can use it for rendering your style in a way and trying to find a correspondence between different disciplines. For example, when you try to use a very comprehensive metaphor to describe some super complex science theory. An LLM can usually give you some options that you can choose from…","I will use different models for different purposes, and I will separate different tasks. Maybe one big task, you can break it down to different small parts and you give it to this model or give it to that model, or you might want to rerun an output in a different model 1 And you try to find the best outcome. But you have to, I mean, you have to train yourself with some kind of good taste.","This question of taste reappeared throughout the process, craft, and philosophy sections of our conversation. Taste and agency have been two buzzwords of 2025, for anyone tech-adjacent and terminally online.","My question to Stanley, then, was: Can you improve your craft as a fiction writer using LLMs? If so, how? This was a question that was particularly on my mind as someone relatively new to fiction writing. It seems like a skill issue not to have found a good workflow for this. Stanley agreed – improving your craft happens beyond the actual writing practice. An LLM can give you options, and your job as the writer is to have a consistent taste to discern which among them serves your vision.","[10:04] I always rewrite. I couldn’t use even a single line it gave me directly. I think in a way there’s some legal issues. But through time and through your career, you raise the bar. You have a higher understanding, you have a deeper understanding of writing as a craft. You have to redo it over and over again. When you find your touch, you find the right feeling. I think that’s the most important thing.","This really reminded me of a college professor I had who swore by manually retyping code snippets from Stack Overflow. “You’ll see what’s wrong with it and change it when you rewrite it,” he said.","My former Spanish teacher said something similar. His rule was that when using Google Translate, even if you know the translation it gives you is correct, you still have to re-type it yourself. And then when you do, you often notice ways in which it was subtly wrong.","Oh, and speaking of translation –","Stanley and Ken Liu have had a multi-year, two-way partnership in translation – Ken Liu translated Stanley’s Waste Tide into English. Stanley translated some of Ken Liu’s work into Chinese.","[11:46] When I translated some of Ken Liu’s work into Chinese I used an LLM to find the tongue. I think it’s very difficult to capture the style, the tongue. It’s at the inter-linguistic level. You have to find the right slang, for example, or the right metaphor. Sometimes there are some cultural references that might not be able to directly attach with something in Chinese, or the other way around. So I think it’s always useful to use LLMs to help you to find something you know as a counterpart of the the language and the culture. Again, this is about taste . If you are bilingual you can feel the nuance and you can feel the subtlety of the language and the literature and you you might feel, “oh this is not exactly what the author tried to do in the original version.”","So sometimes they do experiments as well. The previous work can be referenced, but it’s not exactly the same, right? So we have to... dive deeper and we try to understand what the author really tried to do. And we come up with this idea, or maybe we could create this kind of style in Chinese to fully capture what the author tried to do. And we try to have the LLM represent what we think might be correct or close enough. But again, it’s not easy. So maybeit’ll give you the mediocre, or an average level of translation.","So I think this is like back and forth. I don’t think you can fully rely on LLM to do the translation, especially on literature.","Again, the role of the LLM here, in Stanley’s view, is largely to present you with a palette of options.","So what’s happening in between, then? What’s happening while you’re redoing it over and over again, prompting the LLMs and letting them prompt you back?","[28:48] As with every tool, you can use it in a dumb way, or in a smart way. You can use it to be lazy, or you can use it to challenge yourself. You think firstly and you see what the AI gives you and you try to compare the two. And you can see, okay, maybe this is what I’m missing here. These are my blind spots and there’s something nice, nicely done there. So maybe this is the focus area I should look into next time. So I think it’s a very good practice for your brain, for your imagination, for your narrative...","This was the thread I was really trying to pull on throughout our entire conversation. What does it look like, to Stanley, to use LLMs in a smart way?","It means being in dialogue with them, and being fluid about their role in your process. I asked Stanley what his mental model is when he uses AI in his fiction process – tool, palette, partner? Something else?","[4:52] It’s inter-subjectivity, so it’s something in between. You can see this subjectivity shifting or flowing between me and the machine in a distributed way. So I think all the magic happens in between. During the process, you know, think about electricity, think about the energy flows.","Generative technologies offer new opportunities to interact with your characters and to discover them, even as the author.","[15:05] I’ve been playing with Midjourney and, recently, with Sora 2. It’s very interesting because when you have a character in your imagination there’s a distance, right. It’s kind of vague, kind of abstract. But when you transform it into a very vivid and and visually stunning image, even an animation, you give it more information. You might be triggered with a sense of how the character acts, or talks, or responds to certain scenarios.","What does it look like, though, to flesh out those characters, and to visualize them within the space of Sora or similar tools? Stanley experimented with assigning characters into the 16 Meyers-Briggs personality types.","[16:49] Now you can divide yourself. You can role play with different personalities. Each type could be attached to specific characters. You can interact and this becomes a role-playing game, like LARP. But also I think in the future, we might use Midjourney or Sora to do a real role-playing game. Everyone could create something like that. It’s not only writing a novel, but also creating something visually. I think that’s the future.","He’s been involved in an immersive drama production in Hangzhou. The premise is that its eight characters are all reincarnated.","[19:25] We have previous lives, we have this life, and the next life. When people buy the ticket, if they pay more they can see different lives. If they pay less they only see this life. So they can choose, just like in Sleep No More in New York. And you can follow different story lines to explore. I found it fascinating because there are some interactions between the characters and the audience. And it might trigger something that wasn’t in the script. Sometimes the character might have to improvise. But from the very beginning, we had like a big Bible defining the world building, and each character, like attached to the different lives. Part of their identity and part of their personality has been changed, like your job, your career, even your appearance, but part of it, like the soul, you know, like some addiction, like some fears, like some anxiety pattern has not. This is a very different way of creating and also a different way of storytelling.","However, Stanley cautions, you still need to be deliberate about how much information you are providing to your readers.","Unveiling the process is helpful to a point, but the work needs to stand alone. The artist should clearly have a vision about where the work ends and what the reader needs to figure out on their own.","This is one of the aspects I admire most about Stanley’s fiction. As much as the process is important, and as much as he’s been willing to publicly share about it – including in this interview – the work itself is the thing.","[21:07] Maybe there’s some fan fiction – readers can develop the character by themselves, they might have some alternative history, some subplots – like branches, storylines. So they can develop something like that. But I think to me what I should reveal to the readers is already written. You can interpret it by yourself, that’s your freedom. I always say, OK, just figure it out by yourself because what I want to say is already written there.","Even the endings. With a semi-open ending a lot of people ask me, “what does it mean?”","You have to fill in the blank with your own imagination. I think that’s the best part of it. You can keep guessing, you can keep thinking about it. That’s what I try to do.","Part of shaping the future with writing is about experimenting with form and embracing the new.","I asked about the prospects for young, emerging authors:","[48:59] They are suffering because there’s no platform at all. There’s no publication. There’s no opportunity for them. So I think this is very, very cruel. People feel angry. People feel that they’re outliers, that they’ve become irrelevant in a way, right. I don’t see an easy solution here.","But I always told my students, you have to create your own job in the market. Maybe it doesn’t exist yet, but you have to start to get down to work and start to build your own career, not just waiting there, waiting for some companies, you know, some bosses to give you one, to offer you one. I think this is the reality.","And with AI, I think, yes, they can do it, but they need to refresh their experience. They have to unlearn whatever they’ve been taught, you know, from the traditional schools or parents or educational institutions.","In his own work, Stanley has been very proactive about forming partnerships with people directly making decisions that impact the future.","While he’s a sci-fi writer, he has been invited give guidance in technology and  economics discourses.","So what perspectives does he find it useful to share in those forums?","[56:36} We’re so small, we’re so powerless. This is a structural asymmetry. I think punk, like solar punk, basically is what we need here. And how we should do that starts from creating new kinds of metaphors. Because metaphor is how we package and compress all this storytelling, emotion, ethics, values, mythology all together. It’s like a super efficient info pack. But it takes a very long time to form a metaphor. So that’s why we should start now. We need some time to build up new metaphors…","I try to shift the vision for these people because they are the one who spend the money, make the action and policy-making, etc. I think you should do something to change the narrative, change the metaphor and tell a new story and create a new myth for the future.","Lastly, I couldn’t resist asking about some specific procedural steps:","[7:40] I think Claude is good on the language level – it is more nuanced, is more human in a sense. But I found it couldn’t do full-width punctuation marks in Chinese. I’ve tried different ways to teach it how to use the right marks, but I fail all the time. Gemini has a longer context window so it allows us to have novel length materials. And you try to summarize something or you try to dig deeper in a very accurate place, even down to sentence level. Gemini helps a lot in doing this kind of long text task. So I think, of course, different models, they have different characters and they have their different styles.","You have to really dig deeper and try to find your own pipeline. I think this is very unique individually. Design and curate your own pipeline to better optimize your workflow. This is how I adapt myself to this new way of working, new way of writing.","Listen to the full conversation that I had with Stanley:"],"tags":[]},{"id":55,"title":"Bridge Atlas Episode 3: Commons","subtitle":"Issue #70: A conversation with Yancey Strickler and Trent Van Epps","author":"Unknown","content":["Welcome back to another episode of Bridge Atlas , a video podcast series hosted by Christine D. Kim . In this episode, we discuss Ethereum through the lens of the commons with two Summer of Protocols alumni: Trent Van Epps and Yancey Strickler .","Listen to the full episode","Christine: Trent, can you start us off with an intro. What’s your background?","Trent: Sure. My background is in architecture and design, but I got pulled into Ethereum a few years into my career because I’ve always been fascinated by systems. I now work at the Ethereum Foundation on protocol coordination – that means managing changes to Ethereum’s core software, coordinating releases, and engaging stakeholders. One of my main projects is Protocol Guild, which is a collective funding endowment for about 200 core contributors working on Ethereum’s foundational protocols.","Christine: Yancey, how about you?","Yancey: I’m a writer and entrepreneur. I co-founded Kickstarter and led it as CEO, started The Creative Independent, and more recently, I’ve been working on Metalabel – a studio for group projects and tools, both onchain and offchain. I’m also involved in Artist Corporations, which is a project to create new corporate structures for creatives, and Dark Forest Operating System, which is about private internets for groups with shared space and resources.","Christine: It sounds like both of you have taken unexpected paths into your current work. Yancey focuses on creative commons, Trent on Ethereum commons. Trent, can you define “Ethereum commons” for us?","Trent: I think of commons as systems for shared production and management of resources over time. Open-source software, like Ethereum, is a shared resource requiring governance and trade-offs. Ethereum fits into the “digital commons” category – a shared resource producing digital goods. The goal is to distribute value widely, but there’s always a risk of capture by capital interests, which can make these resources less “magical.”","Christine: Yancey, do you see parallels with the creative commons?","Yancey: Definitely. Creative commons rest on public goods like music theory, colors, and cultural building blocks. Standards like Creative Commons licensing are vital, because if standard-setting is left to commercial actors, you risk a race to the bottom. Managing commons well requires daily care – it’s easy to let things degrade, and hard to restore them once they do. Ethereum has an advantage over centralized Web2 platforms because its public goods are more resilient and not dependent on a single decision-maker.","Christine: But neither Ethereum nor creative commons sustain themselves automatically – they need tools and innovations. Yancey, you’ve focused on “labels” as a way to organize creative work. Why?","Yancey: Online culture is very individualistic – everyone builds their own following, which makes you compete with the people who are most like you. But independent record labels historically created alignment between artists: if one succeeded, others benefited. Labels amplify and invite others in, creating a shared credibility and a scene. That’s mostly disappeared online. With Metalabel, we’ve been building tools for group treasuries, revenue splits, and decision-making, so people can collaborate more effectively. It’s about creating alignment and shared identity.","Christine: Trent, does that resonate?","Trent: Yes. Labels have both social and very practical benefits – pooled payments, marketing, representation. In Protocol Guild, when we unite 200 contributors, we gain legibility. Funders can see the collective impact, which makes them more willing to commit resources, like through our “1% pledge” initiative. This kind of collective representation wouldn’t be possible for individual contributors alone.","Christine: Capital is a big part of sustaining commons. Trent, in a previous talk of yours, you didn’t take a firm stance on whether capital harms or helps commons. Has your view changed?","Trent: Not really – it depends on context. Capital from a multinational with strings attached is different from capital managed transparently by peers. You can’t avoid dealing with money because people need to live. The challenge is doing it in a way that preserves the commons’ integrity.","Christine: Yancey, your thoughts on the impact of capital?","Yancey: Money has huge influence, but the real driver in any project is whether it’s interesting enough for people to commit their time. Local capital can help; outside capital can distort incentives. Sometimes outside funding is the only option, but it comes with tension. Ultimately, the desire to participate is the most important currency.","Christine: That reminds me of Nadia Asparouhova’s book Working in Public , about the thankless nature of maintaining open-source projects. Money helps, but it’s complicated.","Trent: Exactly. Ethereum started as an ideological project, and intrinsic motivations still drive many contributors. Protocol Guild’s goal is to make funding a non-issue so people can focus on what brought them here.","Christine: Crypto tools like ICOs made it easy to bootstrap projects and directly connect with audiences. But Yancey, you have said that crypto isn’t fully mature for creatives. Still true?","Yancey: Yes. I think crypto’s future is as backend infrastructure – stablecoins integrated into mainstream finance. Creators will be consumers in that system, but things like “creator coins” are alienating to many artists. Financializing yourself is a big cultural leap that most creative people don’t want to make. The DeFi toolkit is exciting to crypto folks but off-putting to most artists.","Christine: That’s interesting – Protocol Guild wasn’t built by DeFi experts either. Trent, how do devs feel about being exposed to the speculative side of crypto?","Trent: Mixed feelings. Each wave of crypto innovation – ICOs, DAOs, NFTs, prediction markets – attracts speculation, and that’s what gets public attention. Core devs believe in the tech’s potential but often dislike how it’s used. Still, there are valuable kernels in these ideas that could mature into better models.","Christine: That leads us to the question: are Ethereum’s ends aligned with its means? How could it better align?","Yancey: Honestly, I’m not sure what Ethereum’s ends are. My guess is it’ll succeed as a new layer for internet money, making some people rich, but without replacing existing power structures. The revolutionary dreams might not materialize.","Trent: I’m more optimistic. The real unlock is governance – DAOs managing value among distributed parties. We’re seeing early legislative recognition of onchain organizations. That’s promising long-term.","Christine: Yancey, tell us more about Artist Corporations.","Yancey: They’re a new corporate form for creatives, blending LLC flexibility with cooperative and IP-ownership features. Groups could pool for healthcare, hold shared IP, and scale up or down. We’ve started a nonprofit to pass laws enabling them and to educate creatives on governance and finance.","Christine: I think Ethereum’s “ends” are still up for grabs. The protocol is malleable now, but it’s heading toward ossification. Different stakeholders, from corporates to creatives, can influence its trajectory – but the window is closing. There’s no single feature that will “fix” things for artists; it’s about keeping Ethereum accessible, cheap, and permissionless while scaling and preserving its unique values.","Trent: Yes – amidst all the speculation, valuable projects will emerge over time. The key is to maintain Ethereum’s core values against commercial pressures. We want it to be dependable infrastructure, like a natural commons, shaped by humans but resilient against turmoil.","Yancey: Agreed. Ethereum should be trustworthy, stable, and conservative in governance – focusing on making its core incredibly strong. That’s the only way to think long-term.","Trent: Some criticize Ethereum’s slow pace, but that’s part of ensuring it lasts. We see it as infrastructure for millions – maybe billions – and want it to operate consistently and dependably for generations, like ecological software maintained by people who care.","Christine: That’s a great note to end on – ambitious, but with clarity about what the Ethereum commons is and what it’s building toward."],"tags":[]},{"id":56,"title":"Perception Must Preserve","subtitle":"Issue #75: Unveiling Zoothesia, a new story arc","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: A world where augmented reality overlays are widespread, offering their users beautiful facades – day, after day, after day… until even the most beautiful sights seem tame and lifeless. The first installment in a new series from Spencer Nitkey.","I never saw a drug dealer on the corner of Second and Poplar until I was looking for one. Sure, there’d been a taped off construction zone – one that, frankly, I was getting pretty sick of having to walk around – but never a dealer. Everything else was the same as always. The same “perfect” sunny 72-degree day my overlays had been feeding me for three months straight. The same subtle sting in my lungs on each inhale, remnants of some distant fire winds had dragged southward into Mayaford City that the overlays couldn’t remove – skin deep AR is, well, not the same as lung-deep, I guess. The same khaki parade of commuters I saw every day, but couldn’t ever erase. The goddamn Zoothesia Protocols let you manipulate everything about your overlays except the one thing I’d really want to turn down: other people. ( Zoothesia! Presence is a Present! *gag*). And, OK, I would rather experience a beautiful day than whatever smog-filled sky was really beyond my overlays, but the collective weight of all this sameness was getting harder to bear. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d felt danger.","I rarely even felt discomfort. That feeling was consigned to a memory of watching  horror movies between spread fingers, as a kid in my cousin’s basement.","Hence, my quest for drugs. If my imagination, atrophied and overwhelmed by choice, couldn’t rouse me, I needed a synthetic solution. I’d settled on MDMA, after some research, because I wanted something guaranteed to make me happy. These days, even smiling children irritated me. I spent weeks trying and failing to figure out how, or where, to buy drugs.","Then I saw him, suddenly occupying the barely-under-construction corner. He wore a large jean jacket with a Keith Haring reprint stitched on the back, an 11pm shadow, and sunglasses. I watched him slide a woman with tattered clothes a bag of something. She smiled, gave him money, and walked away.","Buying drugs was easier than I thought it’d be. I asked for them, he asked how much, and when I looked at him panickedly, he rephrased and asked how much money I wanted to spend. He was shockingly polite, which cut hard against my sense of drug dealers as grimy, life-ruining assholes. The last thing he said stuck with me as I left.","“I’m out here every day.”","I walked past this corner on my daily commute. I’d never seen him. Not until I wanted to, I guess. How much of life was happening beneath the veneer of my own inattention? Everything I seemed to notice was boring at best. Hopefully, the drugs would shake something loose. Or I’d at least feel something for a few hours.","I probably shouldn’t have bought them on my way to work. I was new to the whole thing. All day long, I felt like they were seconds away from spilling out onto the beige carpet of my office. To soothe my nerves, I selected a calming ambient track from an opaque overlay menu that popped into view with a chime and a note about my elevated heart rate. I picked a whale song titled Marine Serenity: Safe Waters in Your Social Seas . One of my coworkers kept talking to me about his children both having ballet recitals at the same time in different places. Lukas, this. Lukas, that. Lukas, you wouldn’t believe how conflicted I am. I tried to drown his voice out, but the volume limiter obnoxiously reminded me to be present in the present . You couldn’t fully mute any living creature. Though you’d think they’d at least let me mute my neighbor’s basset hound at five in the morning. The protocols were like those obnoxious hippie parents. They hovered just as much as helicopter parents, but were less honest about it. I sighed and contented myself by selecting a saccharine pastel visual filter (Pink Sunrises) from another suggested menu, tuning him out the old-fashioned way.","After work I took a cab into Center City and checked into one of the dance halls off Market Street. It was still early evening, but there were plenty of people on the dance floor. Nearly half the dancers had the same kind of “firework” projections – virtual “clothes” that automatically populate others’ overlays – that I’d been seeing everywhere. Waves of neon, jaguar print, and blooming flowers.  They all looked like bad genAI Pollock pastiches, and I did not understand the appeal.","The music was loud and a little grating. I almost left.","But I swallowed the pills and the world opened. The music pulsed with my heartbeat. Strangers’ eyes were warm and empathetic. Colors bled and bodies dissolved into light. I wanted to be everyone’s friend.","A few hours later, the dance floor was too small. I spilled out into the city. My skin hummed. The entire metropolis wasn’t wide enough to contain me. A stranger streamed past me on an electric scooter, his entire body shone as if gemstones were embedded into his skin. I’d never seen anyone like him before. The sky was a burnt orange, the lights of the city diffuse against the dome of smog I’d felt in my lungs all day. The drugs were working. My overlays had stopped hiding the true sky, probably because they were unprepared for the drug-fuelled vigor with which I was perceiving the world.","I decided to take the line all the way to the Nayanaport docks at the city’s edge. The line hugged the river that bordered the city’s eastern limits. I pressed my face to the smudged glass. In the space between the trainline and the river a canopy of tattered tents interrupted my view. I’d never noticed them before. Small fires burned between the tents, and bodies shuffled, half-shadows. Somewhere in the mess a larger fire burned, sending flames skyward. The tents stretched for a mile, at least.","Soon, we were at the last stop. The drugs were beginning to fade, and the smell of the car was stronger than I’d realized.","On the way home, I couldn’t see any sign of the tent city, just long stretches of river and the sun slowly intruding into the dawning horizon.","I called in sick the next morning. As my neurotransmitters slowly returned to their regularly scheduled programming, I looked up “tent cities along the river.” I couldn’t find anything. Puzzled, I made the same train trip later that afternoon, and saw nothing.","The dealer was still on his corner, though.","He looked me over, then grinned. “Back already? Careful. Serotonin syndrome’s real.”","“I’m good. Does that stuff ever cause hallucinations?”","“Last night I saw this whole tent city along the river. This morning, it’s gone”","“A suit saw tent-town? That’s some endorsement for my product. Tent-town is an off-grid alternative living community. Weird stuff. Shocked the Zoo let you see it, though.”","“I thought the protocols had to keep everyone visible at least?”","He gave me a pitying look.","“You don’t know? That was like gen1. The protocols are to ensure that perception doesn’t cause harm. Turns out, sometimes seeing things makes you more likely to do harm. Remember those bugs that screamed when you stepped on them? People started killing them on purpose.”","My head spun. Nobody actually read all the PSAs and changelogs. A billion lines of code and thousands of pages of terms of service hardly made for good beach reading. Last I’d heard, they were adjusting the whole dying animals thing to lessen psychological stress. I hadn’t kept up since then. No one I knew had either.","“Why’d I see it, then?”","“MDMA can spoof the filters. It kind of makes you harmless.”","I knew the protocol wasn’t a person. It wasn’t thinking, but still I wanted to prove it wrong. About me. About all of us.","“How can I see again?”","“Sober? You’ll want a kapala halo.”","“Can I get that from you?”","“It won’t be cheap. And when you get out there, be careful. The Mayasiddha Saints that live there are weird weird. Watch out for the robed ones, especially. Those are the true believers.”","Oren, the dealer, led me through empty alleys and buildings that suddenly hummed with invisible potential. He said he’d get a decent finder’s fee for bringing me to the saints. I wondered how much of the cash in my pockets would end up in his, but I didn’t have another way into this world. The thought of maybe robbing him and getting my money back once he’d secured the halo for me wandered through my mind. It’s not like it was that wrong to steal from a criminal, right? I pushed it away.","“You ever seen a kapala halo before?”","He didn’t pause to let me answer as we walked.","“Adapted from tantric skull cups they were.”","I got the sense that he enjoyed the sound of his own voice – or hated other people’s.","“They’re wild. They came from these old skull chalices that monks would drink from while they meditated in these gnarly open burial grounds,reflecting on death and impermanence and all that shit. Once the Zoo updates started rolling out in earnest, system admins and social workers needed a way to spoof the protocols to be able to see everything. So, bam, the halos. They synthesize the neurochemical signals of a saint, and spoof the Zoo into thinking it’s safe to show you everything. Of course, now there’s a whole supply of, how should I say, black market ones. But don’t worry. This guy’s legit. It’ll be safe.”","Official kapala halos were used to troubleshoot rendering issues, and occasionally by social workers to interface with communities they might otherwise not have access to. Black market ones were used to pry.","The more he explained, the angrier I grew. Not only had the world been hidden from me by some paternalistic prediction model, but access to it was reserved for criminals and social workers. It was bullshit. The whole “protocols for the people” slogan was just marketing.","Oren sat me in a chair on an empty warehouse floor. He told me I’d feel a slight pinch and asked if I was ready. I didn’t see the thing he affixed to me. I didn’t see the person who’d given it to him. I was ready to see the world as it was.","Something cold pressed against my head, and a series of needles pinched along my temple. Oren flipped a switch, and the world cracked open.","A man with six ears growing up his arm was counting my money in the corner of the room. Oren noticed me staring and laughed.","“He foulmaxes so fewer people see him. Helps in his line of work.”","I left the warehouse, immediately disappointed that it didn’t look any different. The buildings were not secretly burning. The corner stores were not secretly fronts for organ dealers. But there were more people than I’d ever seen before. I understood why some had been hidden from me, sure. People who had grown fur atop their skin and implanted shoddy electronics that jagged from them like broken bones. People licking at perpetually open wounds lined with metal. But beyond them, there were far more normal-looking people than I was used to, and I wondered what the protocols had determined was wrong with them. Or me.","I stopped in front of a glass window to look at my reflection. An ivory colored crown affixed to my temple with needles blinked in the daylight air. It was jarring. Was I now excluded from the view of others like me?","We’d come out of the warehouse close to the water. I walked toward where I remembered the tent city being. I smelled it far before I saw its tattered skyline. A ruinous stench. Urine and sulfur and rot – rose miasmatic. It stuck to my skin.","I walked the fence line until I found an archway cut out of it and entered.","A small group of shirtless children with knotted hair nearly tumbled into me in a mad dash toward a bowl of raw meat. They laughed and spoke in a language I couldn’t understand. My anger rose. There were hurting, dirty, abandoned children in this world, and we could help them if the protocols would let us see them.","I continued inward. The smell was so bad I was on the verge of vomiting. A sickly-sweetness undergirded the sulfuric stench. I peered inside a large tent. Dozens of kneeling, dirty men and women waited in a long line. Their exposed backs jutted with blinking metallic rectangles embedded into their skin. With each flashing light, their bodies tensed. Their faces grimaced. Some even muffled cries.  A small woman with dyed, black eyes began taking the rectangles from their bodies one by one. As they were removed, the men and women sighed, opened their eyes, and fell upon the ground. Most smiled, blinking, but a few grabbed at the woman’s wrist and begged her to reinsert it.","“You will receive pain again next week. That is enough for now.”","I shuffled away and hoped no one had witnessed my intrusion. The sin of my sightlessness ate at me. Here, just a mile from my home, while I sipped cappuccinos and laughed about superhero movies and LLM release schedules, there was this place where misguided and brainwashed masochists begged for pain and children ate bloody red meat from bowls like dogs. How could we fix the world if we couldn’t see it?","I did not look inside any more tents as I walked. I considered running, but wanted to prove to the paused protocols that they were wrong about me. First, I would handle this scene, then I would fix it.","A tremendous boulder blocked my path. I considered scaling it before I saw eyes blinking between pink and green gemstone cavities in the rock’s surface. Small, swallowed faces in the rock facade opened and closed their mouths in slow, heaving breaths. They’d somehow been completely embedded in the rock and couldn’t move. I walked around them, nausea cresting, until the tents stopped by the river’s edge, and a bonfire stood before me.","At the feet of the fire, for yards in every direction, dead and dessicated corpses lay. Maggots and flies covered the bodies. The putrifying field wavered with the heat of decomposition in the summer sun. Worse than the dead were the dozens of living men, women, and children who lingered at the periphery. A man with a large group of children behind him pointed to bones and limbs while the children shouted out the name of the body parts, and were met with approving nods. A woman raised a wooden chalice, poured half of its contents over a skinless corpse and then laughed as she passed the cup around to her friends, who each took a sip. A couple was making out against the worming backdrop of bodies, and I couldn’t understand why everyone was acting so goddamn happy. Were they deranged? Brainwashed victims? I couldn’t understand. I could barely breathe in the stench and rot of it all, but everyone here seemed happier than anyone I knew. No one was supposed to live this way.","I resolved to come back with someone. Maybe the cops? At least a flamethrower. We’d rescue the children, the brainwashed, and unscar the land.","I turned to flee, back up the road winding through the tents that I’d followed. A man in a cage rolled down the bumpy dirt, blocking my way. Dozens of logs rolled beneath him, and a bevy of followers dressed in tattered orange robes hurriedly moved the logs from behind the cage in front as the movement continued. These were the Mayasiddha Saints Oren had warned me about. When they reached the edge of the grounds, they lifted his cage from the logs and set him on the floor. In rhythm, they moved the many logs into the fire, feeding it. It roared, and the heat slammed against my face, intensifying the smell of rot.","They carried his cage next, wading through the bodies. I moved at the same time I understood their purpose. They meant to burn him alive.","He spat on my face from inside the cage.","“Who barks in this temple?”","“I’m trying to help you, idiot,” I said, wiping my cheek.","“Bakāsura!” He slung the word venomously.","“You wear a halo but act a demon. First taste of true-sight and you swing like a blindfolded child at everything that scares you. You are no better than your protocols. Play-pretending my father. You who have never smelled the burning marrow. Never watched the shadow rend from flesh and join smoke. Never watched a soul dance dharmic in flaming freedom. Keep your wretched half-life, and leave me my sunning death.”","“There are children watching!” I screamed, unsure how else to react as the rage in my chest flooded my entire body.","“Good.” He turned from me, nose high, like I was an unwelcome stench.","One of the robed monks pushed me back, and they resumed their march toward the fire.","“You shouldn’t be here, phantom.”","As I considered how right he was, my hand grasped a long bone. I would help him, whether he wanted it or not.","I raised the bone above my head, and the world went dark completely. No sound. No sight. Not even the wind on my skin or my heartbeat in my ears. Even with the kapala, my panicked rage and imminent violence had triggered the Zoo. In the absence of anything, I fainted.","I woke with the kapala in my lap staring at the muddy banks of the river. I looked behind me and saw a field of grass that ended in the far distance with a fence. Free of the smell and sights of horror, my senses returned. Without the viscerality of the scene, my reason returned too.","I walked a great distance along the river, thinking through what I’d seen, grateful my AR overlays were functioning again and that I was not being barraged by disgust. The man’s words haunted me. Did I have the right to take his death from him? To judge the lives of those whose urges were completely alien to me. In my rage, I would have burnt those tents to the ground. I’d have bulldozed the boulder. I’d have destroyed their whole city and thought I was doing the right thing.","But would that really have been so bad? I remembered the laughing children, face-first in offal. I remembered the suicidal man, who was not talked off the ledge by his peers, but led to it, told it was meaningful and right. My life had been boring, sure, but it hadn’t been disgusting and painful. It hadn’t been wrong.","I did, begrudgingly, have to admit that the Zoo had been right about me in one way. I was not ready to see the whole world without hurting it. But, I think it was wrong, too. Maybe some things deserve to be hurt, hunted, and erased. Surely I wasn’t the only one who had seen the things they weren’t supposed to and wanted to do something about it. I’d find them, those others, and we’d find a way to act on the world as it is, with or without the Zoo."],"tags":["Liked by Spencer Nitkey - Writer, Protocolized","Liked by Spencer Nitkey - Writer"]},{"id":57,"title":"Hardwired","subtitle":"Issue #57: Longing for Uptime","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: With connectivity hard-fought and scarce, our protagonist longs for the most painful information that one could receive.

The feeling was pervasive, inserting an insistent, electric scream that promised either fire from the sky or a filament of salvation.","Tom’s hand, resting on the flaking paint of his porch rail, tightened. The rust felt like grit beneath his palm. He’d been alone for months, ever since Jacob had departed on a humanitarian mission in a nearby settlement. If luck still counted for anything, his son might be alive.","The porch itself was barely standing, its joists warped and split from years of neglect, yet Tom clung to it as though it were the last post holding up his world. From his house, built upon the highest hill in town (if one still called the settlement a town), he could see much of Providence. Roofs sagged beneath patchwork tarps, smoke leaked thinly from chimneys that should have been condemned, and the main thoroughfare was a scar of cracked stone lined with stalls that rarely held more than boiled roots or scavenged wire.","He remembered when those streets had been filled with color and noise. Jacob and the other boys raced bicycles between market tables, voices echoing off the rail yard. His wife leaned over their balcony, waving him inside before dinner went cold. That world had died by increments, until even memory felt dangerous, a soft indulgence in a place that allowed none.","Still, traces clung. The neighbor’s child, Mira, drew chalk figures on the wall opposite his porch, their crude lines washed away by the next rain. Someone had planted potatoes in an old oil drum. A faded mural of birds stretched across one building, now streaked with soot. Reminders that Providence had not entirely forgotten how to live, but had forgotten how to expect more.","Tom’s chest tightened at the thought of Jacob somewhere out there, walking through landscapes more broken than this one. The rail bit into his palm, anchoring him in the present as the rattling air built toward its promise.","The compound was quieter now than it used to be, he thought as he listened carefully. Before the Invasion, Tom had lived near a train yard, and even after the railroads were bombed, other sounds had replaced the ghost noise of locomotives: the thump of people in the streets, market chatter, a bicycle bell. Now the only sound was the creak of boards under his neighbor’s steps overhead, followed by the faint clink of a kettle lid.","A shout from the watch post cut through the drone’s building cry. “Profile is a quad! Repeat, quad-rotor, not a Kestrel. I see extended battery packs. No ordnance. It’s a Runner!”","Providence released its collective breath in a ragged sigh. A woman carrying a bundle of herbs unconsciously let her shoulders drop. A man leaned against a wall, pressing a hand to his chest. The tension did not vanish, but it transmuted into something sharper: a desperate, clawing anticipation.","The drone, its matte-grey fuselage scored and pitted from countless journeys through contested airspace, swept over the compound wall. It descended with unnerving intelligence, optical sensors mapping the debris field that had once been the town square. It settled in a clear patch beside the decapitated bronze figure of a forgotten statue, its motors spinning down with a final, sighing buzz.","The square had once been the heart of Providence. Before the barricades rose, Tom remembered it as a place where the train workers would gather after shift, trading laughter for bread and tobacco, where Jacob once clambered onto the statue’s pedestal to shout imaginary speeches to passersby. Now the statue’s head lay face down in a drift of ash, its green patina worn smooth by years of acid rain. Weed tufts sprouted between fractured paving stones, and the basin of the old fountain had become a catchment for rust-brown runoff. Beyond the barricades, the forest loomed, its treeline a serrated wall of chlorophyll so dark it seemed to drink the light. Tom always felt as if the trees listened. On quiet nights, when the wind shifted, he could swear he heard breathing from within their ranks.","People gazed at the drone as though it were a relic, their faces taut with reverence and fear. A woman in a coat stitched from two different uniforms clasped a pendant in her hands, lips moving in a private prayer. Children craned their necks to glimpse the machine, their eyes wide, though none dared step forward.","From an armored housing bolted to the underside of the drone, a silica filament, no thicker than one of Jacob’s hairs, spooled outward, vanishing into the treeline toward a faraway relay.","The engineering team was already moving, their boots crunching on broken pavement. Lena, their technical lead, didn’t waste words. “Reyes, soldering iron and PCB. Anya, fire up the terminal. Let’s get a handshake before something in those woods gets possessive.”","The crowd pressed in, a silent, anxious ring of onlookers. They watched Lena’s bare, nimble fingers work on the drone’s housing as if she were performing a sacred rite. Reyes knelt beside her, soldering iron already in hand. “Easy with that,” Lena murmured, not looking up. “That thing could melt the fiber optic strand with a single flick.”","“Don’t worry,” Reyes muttered back, eyes narrowed in concentration as he finished connecting the fiber to the relay station. “I only melt the expensive stuff on Tuesdays.”","Tom’s heart hammered against his ribs. He felt the press of bodies around him, smelled the communal scent of damp wool, woodsmoke, and anticipation. Lena turned the terminal on. The screen blinked, then filled with lines of flowing green text, a digital prayer answered.","\\text{INITIATE_HANDSHAKE: F-O_TETHER_7B41} \\\\ \\text{SRC_NODE: FT_NC_04 (FORTITUDE)} \\\\ \\text{DEST_NODE: PV_NC_02 (PROVIDENCE)} \\\\ \\text{ENCRYPTION: AES-256_GCM} \\\\ \\text{AUTHENTICATING...} \\\\ \\text{SIGNAL_STRENGTH: 98.7\\%} \\\\ \\text{LINK_ESTABLISHED}","The text dissolved into a staticky image that coalesced into the face of a grim-looking man in a headset – the relay officer, Fortitude’s Caller. “Providence, you have the Tether. Fortitude is receiving. Clock is hot. Lena, you have the window.”","Lena stepped forward immediately. “Intel. We had a Kestrel patrol probing the eastern perimeter three days ago. Anything on your side?”","“Negative, Captain,” the Caller said. “West has been quiet. Advise you watch your six. Scavs are getting bold. Next.”","A young man shoved his way forward. “Message for Elara Vance! It’s Ben!”","The Caller’s face was replaced by a woman’s, gaunt but beautiful. “Ben! Are you okay? The fever…?”","“Broke yesterday,” he said, his voice cracking. “I’m okay. I love you. I…”","“Time,” the Caller stated, his face reappearing. He wasn’t cruel, just a metronome for their fleeting connection. “Next.”","A mother showed her husband the first drawing their daughter had ever made. A mechanic asked about the voltage tolerance on a salvaged condenser. Each exchange was a frantic burst of data, months of longing compressed into ten tightly policed seconds.","Tom felt Captain Rostova’s hand on his arm, guiding him forward.","“Request from Providence for an update on Jacob,” the Caller announced.","The screen shifted. The face that appeared was Elias, Jacob’s old squadmate. He looked ten years older than the last time Tom had seen him. The hope in Tom’s chest became a cold, heavy stone. He saw the answer in the pity etched around Elias’s eyes.","“Elias,” Tom breathed, his voice a dry rasp. “It’s Tom. Tell me.”","Elias’s mouth opened, forming words Tom already knew. “Tom, I… we went out to the northern pass. The Ranger team he was supposed to meet…”","A terrible low-frequency thrum vibrated up from the distant forest. It was not a sound, but a physical force. Lena, watching the tension monitor on the cable anchor, screamed a single word: “Snag!”","The silica fiber, which had hung with a gentle curve toward the forest, snapped guitar-string taut. On the screen, Elias’s grieving face fractured into a million dying pixels of light. The anchor port snapped as it was ripped from the terminal, the cable connector whipping past Lena’s head.","Later, long after the square had emptied and Providence had settled back into its uneasy rhythms, fragments of the shattered silica fiber would be found scattered among the underbrush at the forest’s edge. The tiny glints of filament caught the wind, trailing like silver threads through moss and bracken, reminders of the connection that had been cruelly brief.","Tom thought of Elias’s words, halting, heavy with grief – but unfinished. He hadn’t said Jacob was gone. And that pause, that small, aching ambiguity, would drive Tom to keep listening hopefully for that next telltale whir.","Explore the strange new rules shaping our future.

Yet, more planet-shaping history has flowed through this short and narrow geographic bottleneck than across the entire rest of the Himalayas and adjacent ranges combined, which form a largely impassable natural border between South Asia and the rest of Asia. A border more formidable than the Pacific Ocean.","The pass is a narrow bridge not just between two geographies, but between two streams of world history. Over millennia it has witnessed and shaped the rise and fall of empires on both sides. Conquering armies and vast rivers of trade and commerce have flowed through it. Traders, diplomats, explorers, scientists, and religious evangelists have kept up a steady flow of ideas, wealth, and power flowing in both directions. Without the Khyber Pass, South Asia would have perhaps been as isolated from world history as Australia, and the history of the world would have been radically different.","Yet, despite its obvious importance, the pass is a small patch of land that is remarkably hard to find on a map. It does not matter whether the map is political or geographic, or what clever projection you use. It is just very hard for a traditional map to represent the Khyber Pass in a way proportionate to its significance. A significance rooted in the dynamic flows of our planet rather than its stocks: The static topography of containment and boundaries.","The problem is not unique to the Khyber Pass. Despite the obvious (and as I will argue, growing) value and importance of viewing the world from vantage points like the Khyber Pass, we humans are remarkably bad at developing worldviews anchored in flow-based vantage points located on bridge-like elements on maps.","In fact, we do not even normally think of a bridge as a vantage point at all. A bridge is a space you typically cross quickly rather than linger on, even when the view is spectacular, as it often is. Bridges, understood as metonyms for a larger class of geographic connection elements, which includes straits, passes, tunnels, and administrative border crossings, are liminal spaces . They connect two realities with sufficient kinship to justify a connection, but divided by some sort of natural or artificial barrier. To cross a bridge is to undergo a mental shift. To linger on a bridge is to be of two minds for a spell. It is an uncomfortable state to inhabit. Too many dimensions, many in tension with one another, are alive. Too few have been flattened to allow us to sustain the comforting identities we can securely inhabit on either side of a bridge. The view from a bridge may be spectacular, but being on a bridge is not comfortable unless you’ve trained yourself in appropriate ways.","Bridges demand that we inhabit more powerful, higher dimensional selves at least while we’re on them. Selves that can, at a prosaic level, at least navigate multiple languages, currencies, measurement systems, and political narratives. But while a certain aptitude for pluralist, polyglot, even mongrel states of being is necessary to constitute such selves, it is not sufficient.","We need something more – what we at the Summer of Protocols have been calling protocol literacy: A more holistic and native level of comfort in and around bridge-like spaces.","Bridge-based identities, like Silk Road trader or diplomat, demand a praxis of transcendence of narrower identities even to sustain basic existence. Historically, very few humans had the opportunity to acquire such identities – sailors, diplomats, traders, soldiers.","In our postmodern world, increasingly all humans must develop bridge-rooted identities, and we are all struggling with the challenge. The Covid pandemic showed us just how bad we are at this. Our stocks-based minds struggled to wrap themselves around supply chains and flows. Our ineptitude is only getting costlier, as new flow-based confusions and conflicts emerge at all levels, from rare earths and semiconductor supply chains, to climate refugee flow management, to AI turning familiar stocks of inherited civilizational knowledge into oozy flows of live intelligence.","So perhaps the first thing we need, to allow us to acquire the higher levels of protocol literacy the world demands of us today, is better maps of the world. Maps that privilege flows over stocks, bridges over borders, and in-betweenness over stable perspectives and subjectivities. The traditional school atlas you may have grown up with is no longer enough. We need a new kind of atlas.","In this essay, I want to introduce a new frame that we at Protocolized (and the parent Summer of Protocols program) have become enamored of in recent months – that of the bridge atlas. A set of perspectives of a world centered on its bridges – connection points between relatively homogeneous regions separated by borders, and marked by powerful, transformative flows.","Our fall programming revolves around the motif of bridges, and the larger scaffolding of bridge atlases. Three highlights:","We are announcing our third protocol fiction contest today, Building and Burning Bridges (check out details here ; deadline for entries is December 1, 2025 ).","We will shortly kick off a special series of Bridge Atlas salon conversations , hosted by Christine Kim, which will surface “bridge perspectives” of computing futures, viewed from paired crypto and non-crypto vantage points.","For those of you who plan to attend Devconnect (the flagship Ethereum event in Buenos Aires, November 16–22), we have a day-long event, also titled Bridge Atlas . The goal of this event will be to map and build bridges between the future as imagined by the Ethereum community, and by others imagining their own versions of futures. If you are planning on going to Devconnect, and consider yourself a self-appointed Ethereum ambassador, building and traversing bridges to other worlds, this event is for you. Register here .","In case it isn’t obvious, we at the Summer of Protocols are interested in bridges because protocols of all sorts – diplomatic, technological, climate, blockchain, AI – are bridge-building and flow-shaping technologies. If physical bridges, passes and straits are hard to see on maps of the planet, the larger universe of protocols is almost entirely invisible. The technological equivalent of dark matter and energy.","The cultures that emerge on top of any physical or conceptual geography of bridges are fundamentally rooted in bridge-based perspectives. The people who successfully inhabit those cultures tend to be precisely the ones who are able to develop the complex, higher-dimensional identities it takes to view, navigate, and act on the world from bridge-like loci.","In what follows, I want to lay some philosophical groundwork around why the views from bridges are so valuable, especially if you are able to view a reality from multiple bridges, and organize your larger understanding of our world in terms of bridge atlas worldviews. We hope this introductory essay and our Fall programming will get you bridge-pilled (a sub-condition of being protocol-pilled – our entire program is a literacy program based on pushing a bunch of pills).","A traditional atlas is already a valuable construct. Instead of offering a single map with a single center, with a view of a single reality, it offers many views of many related realities, and does so in a polycentric way .","A single map must necessarily feature the distortions of a single projection. An atlas on the other hand, can attempt to be aware of the distortions of single projection techniques, and combine many in order to try and create balance. And unlike a globe, which lulls us into a false and somewhat useless sense of three-dimensional spectatorial integrity, an atlas leans into the inevitable fragmentation we must navigate in dealing with high-dimensional realities with low-dimensional sensoria (and our planet certainly features many dimensions both globes and 2d maps flatten).","An atlas never lets us forget that all perspectives are partial, the result of tradeoffs among different aspects we might want to represent, and inevitably feature distortions. And that it cannot be otherwise.","A bridge atlas kicks the ambition level up a notch.","Crack open a modern atlas. You’ll find a set of maps that cover areas at different scales. You’ll find multiple maps offering different perspectives on the same underlying reality, such as physical vs. political maps. You’ll even find a variety of projection methods in use, that attempt to account for different distortions and prioritize different aspects of 3d geometry in 2d representations – areas, shapes, distances, oceans vs. landmasses, polar vs. equatorial regions.","What you won’t find, though, are representations that center connection over separation . Bridges over borders. At best, you’ll find connectivity data (such as air or sea routes) layered on top of primary representations that prioritize regions that serve as conceptual centers, and the borders separating them. The logic is that of a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE) set of containers that carve up a world rather than a network that scaffolds its liveness.","This is not a trivial point. The more dimensions you want to capture in a representation of a reality, the more valuable connection points become, as perspective anchors. Though computer maps present the familiar regions-and-borders view of paper maps, mapping software relies on underlying connectivity-graph models, which is what you need for actually planning routes.","The problem is not limited to planetary geography. Take, for instance, a rarefied problem in the world of blockchains that is growing increasingly urgent – bridging between cryptoeconomic and traditional economic worlds. It is a problem that offers no intuitive visual interface for navigating it.","For example, consider financial flows, perhaps the most important kind of global flow that are typically not represented at all in any atlas.  Even ancient ones like the hawala network, or hugely consequential ones like the flow of Spanish gold across the Atlantic, cannot be found in modern atlases. Nor can more familiar modern ones such as the SWIFT system. At best, you might occasionally see a graphic with foreign direct investment (FDI) levels overlaid on a world map in a financial newspaper. It is remarkable that such an incredibly important dimension of our planet’s conceptual geography is largely missing from our maps and atlases. Leaving rivers of money off our maps is almost as egregious an omission on a modern map as leaving off actual rivers.","Consider the problem of including a financial flows world map, encompassing both traditional and crypto instruments, in a bridge atlas. Imagine showing how capital is sloshing back and forth across stocks, bonds, gold and crypto, and across borders. Imagining a map that accurately depicts North Korea’s growing treasury of crypto assets, and the geopolitical and international-security significance of that treasury.","Zooming in, the world of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) has radically different (and faster) topologies and temporalities of stocks and flows than the world of TradFi (Traditional Finance). Bridges between the two worlds are fraught places, and often the site of scams and grifts, large and small. It is worth noting that the largest crypto scams have occurred not in the interiors of any cryptoeconomic ecosystem proper, but at the exchanges where crypto and traditional instruments can be traded for each other. And these bridge loci are getting increasingly heavily trafficked. Just one indicator: The annual volume of stablecoin transactions was $27 trillion in 2024, more than Visa and Mastercard combined. Countries around the world are scrambling to develop central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).","How would you depict all this on a map? How would you show how these flows interact with traditional financial and economic flows? How would you show how these flows interact with the broader global political economy, with the ebb and flow of state capacity? How would you show these flows on maps of gray or dark economic activity, including capital flight patterns, smuggling and crime, economic activity in failed states, and funding of terrorism? What sort of map could inform enlightened policy discussions on regulating vs. enabling cryptoeconomics that are able to rise above the current norm of protocol-illiterate flame wars between pro-crypto and anti-crypto tribes?","It’s a daunting cartographic challenge, but one thing seems clear – we would need maps that center bridges and flows, not regions and borders.","And this is just one cartographic problem that an inventive bridge atlas might solve. Imagine applying similar reasoning to climate protocol flows of emissions and credits, distributed AI “intelligence” flows, and of course, all the traditional flows that already keep leaders up at night – electricity, water, food, internet connectivity, pollution, semiconductor supply chain flows, rare earth flows, oil and gas flows. The list of invisible flow layers of the planet just keeps growing. And our cartography is not keeping up.","Simple distortions and transformations of traditional maps are not enough. We need new cartographic foundations not just to understand our world, but to even see it in the first place.","The modern atlas, first developed and named by the visionary cartographer Gerardus Mercator (much-maligned in our time, and rather unfairly so) in 1595, is desperately in need of an update. We need to get beyond the Mercator mindset.","To an engineer studying the abstract geometry and topology of an object of interest, the distinction between borders and bridges is often an academic matter. For instance, two schemes commonly used in robotic navigation to study and scaffold the structure of a space – Delauney triangulation (“bridges”) and Voronoi diagrams (“borders”) – are mathematically duals of one another. Which one you use is a matter of taste, convenience, and computational efficiency. Pure mathematicians often loftily discard the distinction altogether, working with group-theoretic topological representations that transcend lowly geometric understandings of connection and separation.","In the real world of course, things are nowhere near as symmetric or abstractable. We think natively in terms of borders and how they separate regions, which we stably inhabit. Thinking in terms of bridges and how they connect things, and how we transiently inhabit them, is uninituitive and awkward at best.","Bridges, unlike borders, don’t usually draw our attention unless we are in their immediate vicinity. In smaller-scale maps, such as world maps, important bridges, such as between the European and Asian sides of Istanbul, are not even marked. Narrow straits might be reduced to a pixel or two. Exclave corridors, common in convoluted and contested political geographies around needs like ocean access, are often tiny and easily missed. Borders, by contrast, not only straggle dramatically across maps at any scale, but mark sharp visual transitions.","Raised as we are with traditional maps on screens and on paper, our worldviews and orientations are shaped by borders in subtle but powerful ways. And this is true even of our non-geographic worldviews and orientations. For instance, our mental “map of the internet” and its underlying technologies is anchored in continent-like “platforms” and “stacks.” Artists attempting to depict the social or technical geography of the internet visually reach for metaphoric visualizations that owe more to Mercator’s 16th century ideas than to more suitable modern scaffoldings like graph theory or Sankey diagrams (something I myself have been guilty of ). Randall Munroe, of xkcd fame, is among the few conceptual cartographers to even attempt to break out of ingrained cartographic mindsets descended from Mercator, and think beyond borders and interiors. But even Munroe’s most imaginative map (below, he has published several), fails to entirely escape the Mercator mindset, scaffolding the view with IP addresses rather than the communication links among them. The map below is still one based on stocks rather than flows.","To return to our opening example, if we wanted to indicate historical importance of the Khyber Pass on a map, perhaps by sizing segments of the border in proportion to the volume of traffic across them, the few passes through the Himalayas would need to be stretched out radically, and the impassable mountainous stretches of the border would need to be radically shrunk in proportion. Pakistan and Afghanistan would be revealed as being connected by a few graph edges between cities, corresponding to important passes like the Khyber, across the Hindu Kush and Karakoram ranges. Not by the 1640-mile long border (the Durand Line ).","This is not a trivial point – currently inflamed political and ideological discourses around “open borders” rarely dwell on the question of how open or closed borders actually are, or whether bridges might serve as better foci for discourse hygiene. Political scientists are not entirely blind to this phenomenology of course. Many observers have noted that squiggly borders on maps tend to be default-closed (corresponding to contours of natural barriers), while more legible straight borders (corresponding to top-down borders drawn on the basis of administrative priorities and convenience) tend to be default open. Such insights mark the beginnings of cartographic protocol literacy and fluid perspective switching between borders and bridges, flows and stocks, and open and closed interfaces.","Bridge atlases though, should be understood as a more expressive approach to all of cartography, not just the ontological tension between bridges and borders.","Other dimensions of cartographic perspective suffer in similar ways from the Mercator mindset, and might be liberated by bridge-based cartography.","For instance, naive US political maps show an almost entirely red country, raising the puzzling question of why recent elections seem so evenly balanced between red and blue. Maps based on population density, made with diffusion cartogram techniques reveal a truer picture and resolve the puzzle.","Cartograms based on other variables can flexibly present many rich perspectives of a space. Despite the inventiveness of such maps, however, they remain inadequate. The map above, for instance, does not capture a crucially important dimension of the US political landscape – mobility.","Population and commodity flows between and within states, and between urban and rural population centers, have repeatedly shaped and reshaped the history of the United States through its entire existence, yet are largely invisible on maps. Historic flow episodes, such as the settlement of the West, and the great migration to urban centers, show up in histories, movies and even video games (such as the Oregon Trail), but not on the most important orientation artifacts for us spatially dominated primates: maps.","A bridge atlas can begin to address these inadequacies in our orientations. We can begin to see and think natively in terms of connections and directed flows between regions, and the historical temporalities they induce.","We do not yet know how to construct such atlases, but we can imagine techniques such as Sankey diagrams , representing flow volumes between sinks and sources, being adapted to the problem. But for the moment, viewing the world from a coherent set of bridge perspectives remains incredibly hard to do.","So far we’ve considered bridges primarily as situated connectors of adjacent separated realities – the sinks and sources of entangled histories. There is another important aspect to consider – bridges not just as conduits, but as transformers. This is an aspect that rests critically on the fact that bridges, both artificial and natural, are typically more complex and technologically and culturally active, than impassable borders.","Both natural and artificial borders can be dramatic, like the Himalayas or the Great Wall of China. But it is the bridge-like connective elements across borders that embody much of the world’s structural and behavioral complexity, and what we might think of as the information and energy processing aspects of our planet.","Our planet, you might say, thinks with its bridges. They are the synapses of the planetary mind.","A bridge as a transformer operates on the flows that pass through or over it, modifying its informational or energetic character. For instance, when you cross a land bridge, you might enter a regime with different distance units, currency, and language on signage. You might need to switch which side of the road you drive on. When a boat goes through a canal lock, its potential energy is raised or lowered. When electricity flows “across” a transformer, voltage and current levels change. When a token is “bridged” from an Ethereum Layer 2 network to the Layer 1 network, different traffic rules begin to govern it, and the cost to move it around rises.","Engineers often use an overloaded term borrowed from electrical engineering – impedance matching, for the problem of accommodating such differences across things being bridged. As a simple example, the traffic capacities of the roads leading to and away from a bridge must be roughly matched for the bridge to function well as a flow.","Protocol bridges, like their geographic analogues, are fertile sites of both conflict and cooperation, due to the kinds of transformations they effect. For instance, a “bridge” between the ActivityPub and ATProto protocols, meant to connect the Mastodon-based fediverse and Bluesky social media ecosystems, has been the site of intense cultural conflicts in recent years, due to the differences between the norms on the two sides.","A stranger example – the docking mechanism meant to bridge between Apollo and Soyuz modules during the Cold-War-era Apollo Soyuz Test Project ended up being unnecessarily complex because neither side wanted their side of the docking mechanism to be the “female” side of the connection (a natural but symbolically loaded solution to any dynamic connection-engineering problem).","This transformational character of bridges is in fact central to their value as vantage points. On a bridge, normally quiescent variables might be activated, and competing forces which might exclude each other in the interiors of the adjacent regions might be simultaneously active. Consider for instance a border region where currencies of both neighboring countries are accepted by merchants.","A computing metaphor is useful here: bridges are dual boot spaces, requiring hypervisory sensibilities to traverse. At a more cultural level, code switching of some sort may be necessary.","The dynamic vantage point created by the transforming nature of a bridge can even be central to its purpose. In electrical engineering for instance, a Wheatstone bridge is a circuit that measures an unknown resistance by balancing two sides of a circuit. The Rosetta stone bridged ideas across multiple languages, both in its own historical context as a living text, and in our time as an archaeological lens on ancient cultures and dead languages.","Bridges, understood not just as flow conduits between adjacent realities, are dynamic and active conduits that transform the flows they touch (and thereby, the realities they connect). They do not just passively (if richly) observe reality from liminal perspectives, they shape reality from those perspectives, by employing the unique affordances of bridges.","Bridges are, to use a currently popular term, agentic building blocks of our world.","A useful metaphor for remembering this fact is a rather unusual class of bridges: the kind you find on ships.","The “bridge” of a ship is called that because in the early days of steam, a small raised walkway connected the port and starboard paddle wheel housings, to allow the crew to cross from one side to the other without descending to the main deck.","The bridge turned out to be an ideal vantage point from which to navigate, steer, and direct ship operations. Though modern ships no longer feature literal bridges, the term bridge has stuck, and become synonymous with leadership, multiple perspectives, and fluid and intelligent structures of command and agency.","Productivity guru David Allen, in his book Making It All Work, offers a useful 2×2 that we can adapt to understand the particularly potent blend of perspective and control that bridges embody:","From the point of  view of the Summer of Protocols, which to a first approximation is a protocol literacy program, the challenge of building bridge atlases of the world, encompassing not just spatio-temporal planetary realities, but intangible technological ones that are hard to situate in space and time, is one of the most critical projects in epistemology and ontology. Without bridge atlases, we cannot hope to articulate and utilize the growing protocol agencies becoming available to us with any sort of coherence. And given the criticality and consequentiality of the challenges we face, flailing around wildly is not an option.","It is, of course, a project that is far too big for our little program to take on by itself, but we hope to do a few things to help trigger this much needed cartographic revolution – including building bridges to other programs and institutions that recognize the importance of such efforts.","Our bridge-themed Fall programming – Building and Burning Bridges fiction contest, Bridge Atlas Salons series, Devconnect Bridge Atlas day – is meant to get this effort off the ground. We invite you to not just participate in these activities as you’re able, but to imagine and develop your own. We will aim to support such efforts as much as we are able to, and the idea of bridge atlases will frame our 2026 program."],"tags":["Liked by Protocolized"]},{"id":60,"title":"Day Traitor","subtitle":"In Zoothesia, anticipating the market is like baring your soul.

He didn’t like it when overlay settings obscured the real weather from him, even if it was gloomy. He didn’t like ceviche or really any seafood, but only ever said ceviche because he worried saying he didn’t like seafood was a signal of his self-perceived low-class upbringing. He didn’t like it when other men stared too long at his girlfriend, Luna. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust her: it’s that he didn’t trust them. And he didn’t trust himself to reach whatever distant destination she must have projected onto him when she first started dating him, because why else would she be with someone like him?","What he did like was steak tartare, the feeling of sand between his cuticles and nails the day after visiting the beach, money, and winning. OK, fair, who doesn’t like money, or winning for that matter, right? For Ed, money mattered insofar as it was the only reliable metric he’d found to calculate his overall winning-ness, and he liked winning in the kind of way where his family wouldn’t suggest board game nights when he was home for the holidays.","The one thing he hated more than maybe anything else is selling his time for money. Sure, for most people, even Luna, this was a weirdly esoteric way to describe having a job. For someone else, working a job might seem like an easy way to fulfill one’s competitiveness and desire to win. For Ed, though, labor was losing, and a day job was tying yourself to an anchor, sailing out into the middle of an ocean, and throwing yourself overboard.","Which is why, while Ed was walking Luna home one night after a long date, cruising through the city streets with the kind of weightless effervescence that came so naturally to him when they were together, he wasn’t fully present. She was telling him a story he’d heard before, about her childhood on a ranch just outside the city, and the time her brother dared her to jump from the roof into the bed of a truck lined with hay, and how she did it before her brother could tell her he was joking and she snapped a leg, and he didn’t care that he’d heard it before, he enjoyed it more knowing the ending was coming. That wasn’t why he was distracted. She was carrying three long metal sticks that were programmed to bloom into flowers in her overlays that he’d bought a special add-on for so they’d bloom into the panting, smiling faces of her yorkies. He was happy, he even let the overlays replace the gray, February sky, with a bright, crystalline moon and it didn’t matter because when Luna looked up he could see its reflection in her eyes, like the world’s most glorious beachball and he was so happy he wished he could fully inhabit the moment, but he couldn’t. He was busy searching for a way into the better life he was certain Luna had bet on him for. For him, this meant he was always, ambiently, searching for alpha .","Just because he hated having a job doesn’t mean he didn’t have one. He did. He maintained municipal request systems with the help of a coding agent. His real passion, his escape plan, was retail stock trading. He’d have loved to call himself a day trader, but, well, he sold his time for a living, so he couldn’t. Instead, he traded at night using a retail account that his father had given him for his eighteenth birthday with $650 in it. Alpha was what his online trader friends called having an edge on the market that no one else had.","The walk from the bar they’d been at to Luna’s apartment was long. While they walked, Ed scanned the horizon for threats. Not because he knew what he’d do if one came, but because he got the sense that’s how a man should move through the world when he was with someone he loved. He didn’t find any threats. What he did notice was a parking lot outside a small warehouse that was usually empty, suddenly packed full of whirring drones and delivery bots, all this made more curious by the late-night hour. At the next intersection, he noted the cross street, Deva and Market, and had his overlays save that info, along with about 500 snapshot memories he wanted archived from the evening with Luna while he was at it.","After he dropped her off and walked home, he looked up the intersection to find out what company was based there. Delivery movement in the (relative) dead of night is alpha, and Ed loved alpha. Alpha meant money, and money meant winning.","He’d gotten his account up to $1,200 in the five years since his 18th birthday, which wasn’t bad, but hardly the “quit your job and move to Dubai” kind of wealth he craved. One of his online buddies, who recently hit it huge on some biotech play Ed didn’t really understand, liked to call Ed 2L 2 (or: too little, too late), because he had a penchant for getting in just after a balloon, and having a comically small bankroll-to-aspiration ratio.","That night, while the world was sleeping, Ed found the name of the company that owned the warehouse and opened up his retail account. SuryaFlow Logistics was a small, pseudo-national shipping and logistics company based in Mayaport. He’d need more research to bet on what they were shipping, but the level of activity on a weeknight, like he’d seen, and no news reports he could find on the company in the last two months meant something big was coming for them. He messaged FredoubleD, “found a logistics catalyst last night, brother. Could get a gap up at open.” He went, for his taste, all in, and bought up a little more than $900 of shares in SRFL at $23.40 a share.","He told Fred about the trade, and Fred shot back a quick message.","“Don’t just do commons, bro. Grab a cheap weekly call, pussy. Shares don’t do anything. A weekly will print.”","Ed also didn’t like being called cowardly. He bought two weekly call options that would expire in a week and fell asleep with a smile on his face, dreaming of touching down in Aruba, Luna’s arm wrapped around his waist like a bus seat belt, sunscreen already sweating off his forehead.","Two hours after the open, the stock was at an all-time high. Not like, life-changing, IPO of a pre-revenue asteroid mining company that actually breaks ground nine months later high, but high. High enough that on his lunch break, he’d netted $67, most of it from his two call options.","“That’s where the volume is at bb,” FredoubleD messaged him when he posted his profit.","Ed bought Luna a celestial overlay add-on that carved her name and face onto the moon for 24 hours – at least as she saw it. One day, he’d be rich enough to position orbital satellites in a constellation. He’d tell her to turn the overlays off and watch as she saw her name spelled out across the sky.","$67 felt small, pathetic even, the longer he thought about it.","Luna met him outside his office, a crescent moon smile waiting for him – cheek kisses and thank-yous aplenty – but he couldn’t help but feel like there was something behind her eyes that signaled hesitation, maybe even disgust.","He knew he only had a few months left before the gravity of some other, more successful man stole her from his orbit, but tonight he’d focus on her, and worry about his next play when he got home.","Ed didn’t like clubs. He loved dancing. He loved the lasers and strobe lights bouncing off Luna’s sweaty face pressed close to his. He loved music. But he didn’t like clubs. They were filled with better men than him: taller, more handsome, richer men who stared like turkey vultures at him and Luna as if their relationship was a limping coyote seconds from collapse. His defenses had to be up. But Luna loved dancing, too. She loved rum and cokes, and he loved her.","They danced at a club on Market Street where Luna had worked as a bartender years before. It felt emptier than normal. There were almost no men, for one. Still, people were dancing. Ed noticed a lot of them wearing the same kind of virtual clothes, a firework overlay that projected exploding waves of neon, jaguar, and mandalas. They cost $250, and he wished he could buy one for Luna.","The whole time they danced, Ed’s mind was on the quiet periphery of the dance floor. A man, clearly high on something, kept bumping into people and apologizing too profusely. On the floor, the club seemed as lively as ever, but the tables, booths, and lounges that lined the club were half-filled or completely empty. It hadn’t been this slow a month ago, and that had been a Wednesday. It was a Friday night. It didn’t make sense.","Even outside, the street lined with clubs, dance halls, and bars was quiet. This was systemic, not specific.","The rest of the evening blurred, half-paid attention to, while Ed thought of ways to bet on his insight.","He stayed up all night researching what might be behind the dip he noticed, and, strictly speaking, no one was talking about it. Hospitality and nightlife adjacent indexes were trading high, there were no signs of consumer spending decreases, but Ed knew what he saw. He found some statistics that showed men spend, on average, 75% more on drinking out and clubbing than women. This is when things really felt like they were taking off for Ed. The logic seemed solid. If men spent more money clubbing, their absence signaled a decrease in discretionary spending, evidentially appearing in nightlife before other market indicators.","Fred walked him through the simplest way to make money on this hunch, and by the market open he’d spent more than two-thirds of his account on put options, mostly on one big nightlife conglomerate that owned half the clubs in the city, and a couple local spirit companies for good measure. They were all three-week options, and the way Fred explained it, if the stock price dipped below a certain threshold, he could sell his put options – the right to sell a stock at a certain price even after it has dipped – and make a bundle when someone else buys the option from him to hedge their own losses or to bet on a deeper fall. He picked ones with a three-week expiration – Fred did warn him if the price didn’t fall by then, it wasn’t like owning a stock, he’d be left with literally nothing, but it was worth it. What good was $1,700 anyway?","The next two weeks, Ed barely existed. He did nothing of substance except eat, shit, occasionally message Luna, and check his ticker. Luna was on a work-intensive, something about refining mytho-poesis in advertising protocols – which, as best Ed could tell, meant mainlining psychedelics with her coworkers for two weeks under the auspices of creativity. He hated when she was gone like this. The anxiety of being away from her, worried that she’d leave him for Brad or her boss Charlie, mixed with his constant ticker checking created a thick miasma that clung to him.","The prices stayed stable, unmoving, defiant, even. Hell, the alcohol companies he’d bet against actually went up. Luna was due back in two days when the hospitality stock started dropping. A couple of headlines mentioned some behavioral adjustment after effects, but the specifics didn’t matter much to Ed. By the time she was back, the hospitality stock had dropped 15%. He finished the day with his account at $2,500 and a genuine tear in his eye.","Even before telling Luna, he posted the trades on Fred’s forum. The series of fire emoji reactions and “feed us alpha, Edaddy” comments filled him with a pride he wasn’t used to carrying. It felt clumsy, awkward, but he’d learn.","He treated Luna to the best dinner he’d ever eaten when she got back from her trip – cloudy foams programmed to trigger overlay visuals with each flavor, a synthetic dining experience that made Luna shed a tear. The meal was ruined a bit by a waiter who, to Ed’s mind, was flirting ruthlessly with Luna the entire meal, smiling at her, making her chuckle at a pun over the chuck roast. He’d never be as handsome as men like him. He had to be better in other ways. Eventually, the restaurant replaced their waiter with a service bot instead, and he wondered if some floor manager had read the jealousy on his face and course corrected. He still left a tip.","He spent the rest of the evening trawling for his next move. Luna kept asking if he was OK, his eyes trained on the horizon, darting to every storefront and parking lot, looking relentlessly for alpha. Most of the successful retail traders he knew were obsessive researchers, downloading thousands of quarterly reports, market trends, LLM summaries fed to bespoke AI models that spat out suggested plays fed back to an antagonistic LLM for feedback. None of this was available to Ed, and he’d never felt smart enough to pull anything useful from the tools he did have access to. His differentiator sat in meatspace, the messy real world.","In this, his habit of scanning for threats with Luna became a kind of observational practice. Every day she was less his girlfriend and more his training ground, though he’d never have described it that way. The subject of his attention shifted from physical risk to economic indicators, and the obsessive watching was intoxicating, already practiced, and the city was filled with things to notice.","By the end of the month, he’d quadrupled his trading account. A short on athleisure after noticing all his neighborhood gyms empty paid big – reportedly due to a supply chain issue, not Ed’s consumer demand decrease, but who cared, he was right in the only way that mattered. A play on a small robotics firm he’d invested in doubled in value when the company’s CEO appeared on stage with a prominent politician expected to win the next election by a landslide. Ed had invested because their downtown office had grown super busy – windows filled with robotic movements that Ed interpreted as an internal roll-out of a new, as of yet unannounced line. All these wins compounded, and each bet’s returns grew as his investing pool did.","Hundreds of retail traders now shadowed his moves, which he shared online. Someone had made a bot that just copied him exactly and had made almost as much money as Ed did, even with the latency. He had followers invested in his alpha. His account was up to nearly $70,000 by the end of the year. He’d taken Luna to every club, restaurant, and garden she’d ever wanted to visit. Yet she felt distant from him. Distracted sometimes, worried at others. He sensed her slipping in some vital but indescribable way from him. Men seemed hungrier, and she seemed more receptive to their appetites. When a man held the door for her and tried to close it on him, she laughed. She said she was laughing at the man, when Ed looked hurt, but when they kissed each other good night, there was a tight-lippedness to her that kept Ed up all night.","His eyes were dry from being open too long, staring at his ceiling in the darkness when an email ping came through. His overlays notified him that someone with a hedge fund’s domain asked if he’d be interested in coming in and talking. He sat up eagerly and read on.","Abernath was a VP of analysis at MayaForce, the city’s premier hedge fund. Ed didn’t post that he’d accepted the meeting publicly, but in private he messaged Fred.","“They’re either going to make you an offer or an example,” he warned.","“How do I know which one?”","“That’s the tricky part: you won’t.”","The day of, Ed thought about cancelling. He wouldn’t even have to formally cancel, just stay inside, but a custom overlay message from Luna came blaring through his overlays in a wave of sepia. Goosebumps began at his feet and crawled up his body while swirling patterns of lights cascaded down his field of vision. A soft harp plucked a gentle lullaby, and 15 seconds later, when his senses returned to him, a small message appeared reading: “Ed, this is what being with you feels like. Good luck!”","Steeled, he left. For her, he thought, at each street corner that promised him a frictionless life if he just turned back. Until he was at the foot of the tallest skyscraper in Center City.","A massive honeycombed central elevator inside moved people like old pneumatic mail throughout the building, and soon Ed was nestled inside one, being deposited in the office of Abernath.","In place of a sartorial, tastefully grey-haired middle-aged man he’d expected, Abernath looked younger than Ed. He had a checker-pattern undercut, tremendous round glasses that took up the majority of his face, and an oil-stained teal shirt that he wasn’t bothering to have the overlays cover up. He cleared a half-eaten grilled salmon salad from his desk as Ed entered and gestured at the leather chair across from him at the table.","“Sit,” he said, still masticating as he talked.","Ed obliged. Despite the disaffected and slightly slovenly affect, Abernath was everything Ed wanted to be: handsome, rich, unbothered. In the lack of aesthetic curation, there was a confidence that Ed wouldn’t know what to do with if he ever had it.","“Thanks. How’d you, uh, like, find me?”","“Right! Because, I mean a retail trader turning 2K into 70, is – I mean look, it’s personally impressive, but nothing earth-shattering right? Until you smell eight-figures, we usually just can’t be bothered.”","The room got smaller, or Ed did. The modicum of confidence he’d entered with suddenly flat as a day-old soda.","“But, there’s more to it than that, eh?” Abernath finished. He stared at Ed, waiting for an answer.","Ed cleared his throat a few times and shifted in his seat. Abernath’s uncaring eyes sat like placid lake water, undisturbed. Ed sensed that he could watch half the city be swallowed by a fault line from his window and yawn.","“Oh, yeah, you mean the diversity of industries?” Ed ventured. “I do think that probably reflects an edge –”","“Coy. You’re smart. Most people would just dump their actual edge out of excitement. I like it. Look, we both know it’s not that, right? So let’s cut it. I can offer you a big check, a smaller check, and a job, or we can squish you like a screaming bug beneath our callous feet. The first two are cheaper, but the third’s just as easy.”","“I don’t – huh?” Ed was lost, swimming in waters suddenly too deep, too stormy, and too cold. He’d spent hours, maybe if you totalled it all up, days, dreaming of being invited into a room like this, opening some kind of door into the upper echelons of society, and yet here, he felt less like a shining gem plucked from a vein of coal, and more like a fish mistakenly caught up in some fisherman’s net.","“Fine, let’s be ‘open.’ How’re you reverse-engineering the Zoo’s erasures to scrape alpha?”","The room spun a little.","“What?” Ed said. “No, it’s a bespoke observational strategy – real-world research –”","“Please. There’s no real world to research anymore since the Zoo went online, we both know that. Also, look, the pattern’s indisputable. 17 trades built on 17 high-erasure moments. I love that you post your false rationales online, too. Very HODL of you. But we both know. Take your first big win: company hires a bunch of security guards and starts training them in a warehouse parking lot, Zoo reckons they’re a little too fit for a drunk Eddie to handle and disguises them as bots – Presence Must Preserve and all that. You bet the alpha and make a win on their upcoming high value transfer without ever seeing the reality. Or the nightclub fights! You bet on the behavior restrictions since the Zoo was hiding more men than usual from you. That’s the real question: How’d you know? Eventually – and here’s the boot end of things, just to paint a picture – eventually we’ll model it out ourselves, but processing power is processing power, man hours are man hours, and token burn is token burn. So you’d be compensated for the time you save us. Let’s start simple, no trade secrets yet, OK. How can you tell when the Zoo’s covering things up?”","Ed’s confusion mixed noxiously with shame. He was here, in a room where million-dollar deals were treated like grocery store produce. He was inside the wealth machine he’d been working his whole adult life to enter, and yet he felt, in that moment, like a creature being stared at through partition glass.","“But it’s not...” Ed trailed off. His face betrayed his hurt and his confusion.","“Are you reverse-engineering social milieus? That was my bet. Our in-house Zoo parallel says it’s erasing similar-aged attractive males in high-stimulation environments where your jealous-index is likely to tip into action. Am I close?”","“In-house model? Jealousy? No, it’s, it’s real alpha. Low foot traffic nightclubs, late night drone activity signaling production increases. Not absence, presence.” Even as he spoke, he didn’t really believe himself, even though he couldn’t fully believe Abernath either.","Abernath’s cool stare softened with pity. Pity. The shame sliced him like a cardboard papercut, and stammering words poured out.","“Can I use the bathroom?” Ed squeaked out.","“Of course. It’s right by the elevator.” Abernath was already typing as they spoke, moving on from a lowbie like him.","Outside the office, Ed kept shrinking. Distance from judgement did not abate its sting. He stood by the bathroom as the tubes of people sped through the honeycombed structure of the elevator system. Staring at the movement helped keep the darkening edges of his vision from closing in in panic. He noticed that for every dozen or so single-rider tubes, a longer, fatter tube holding multiple people would whirl by as well. He studied the movement for a long time while Abernath’s words sunk like rusty nails into him.","Somewhere in this massive building was a parallel Ed. An Ed born from predictive algorithms and quants and processing and evolutionary simulations, checked at every second against groundtruth data feeds. Somewhere, this False Ed had convinced Abernath and MayaForce that he’d been duped by the Zoo. That the world had been hidden from him because – what? – he liked his girlfriend and worried about other men sometimes? It seemed ridiculous, cartoonish, but he worried about the truth of it.","Most people step into a tube as a kid and step out into a grave, winding along the pressured, pre-bronzed paths someone else had built for them. He had always thought of his trading as a way out of the pneumatic world he thought they all lived in. The idea that even his attempts to jettison the system were, in fact, just another turn in his long, prescribed pipe was untenable.","Next to the elevator were four buttons, two next to an arrow pointing downwards, two by one pointing upwards. Each direction had one button with a single outline of a person and one button with multiple heads crowded together. He pressed the up button with multiple people and waited.","He was going to find this false Ed and… well he hadn’t figured out what he’d do then, either destroy it or unearth its inaccuracies. When a tube came, he squeezed next to ten or so others and sped skyward.","Each level, more and more people left in small groups, siphoned by conference rooms and all-hands appointments. Ed listened to their hushed conversations and felt like they were speaking another language. He knew most funds kept their computation centers high enough for low-latency line-of-sight relays from the roof, so he wound his way up. When the last group of people left the elevator on the 98th floor he slid out with them, unsure how far his visitor’s badge clipped to his belt loop would take him.","He began winding his way through open doors with labels like Data, Matrix, Aquatic Decontamination Zones, server rooms, anything that suggested computation. He wove through labyrinths of hard drives, often finding that he could enter a room, but without a badge swiping back out was impossible. He remembered reading an article about – well, ok fine, reading someone on a chat forum writing about an article they’d read – about the new rat-trap model of security, where companies like this one would pour all their resources into preventing escape from sensitive areas, rather than preventing break-ins. It was simply more efficient, and easier, to keep someone in a locked room than to prevent them from entering one. So for Ed, the only way out was through.","Hallways widened, ceilings shrank, and the floors buzzed with constant humming. He wandered through the ever-densening thicket of silicon and cooling systems. Fewer and fewer screens visualizing what was happening within the machines appeared on the walls. He felt he wasn’t supposed to be here – not in the security sense, but in the sense that these rooms were built for machines, not humans. Ed was lost by now. Intractably lost. A door beckoned from a clearing at the end of one maze, and he opened it, blinded by the sudden access to sun that poured in through a floor-to-ceiling window.","“Just a little light for the IT guys when they’re done wrangling.”","Ed spun to find Abernath leaning against a wall, waiting for him.","“Were you expecting some kind of control room? A nice animated box with your face on it? There’s no center here. Your analog isn’t anywhere. It’s all distributed, all the way down, buddy.”","‘Buddy’ stung, made him think of the middle school bullies he thought he’d outgrown.","“You don’t actually know me, you know,” he said, still squinting in the bright light.","“We know almost everything about you, Ed. The Market actually does know everything, and we figure we’ve got, what, 96–97% of the Market solved. That 3% is where the fun is, sure, but yeah. We know the first thing you’d buy if I gave you a check for ten million right now – it’s champagne, and we know you wouldn’t finish it before it turned to vinegar in your fridge, even with your girlfriend, two or three years younger than you, who you constantly worry you will lose to someone, well, like me.”","Abernath didn’t hold eye contact as he spoke. He had neither venom nor bravado in his speech. As he laid out the details of Ed’s life, it was like he was mindlessly reading a discarded grocery note he’d picked up on the street. The bright light and sheer drop off the side of the building made Ed feel every inch of the 98 stories.","“Think about it. The Zoo already does this. Did you really think there’s only one algorithmic Leviathan? The Zoo predicts who you’ll hurt. The market predicts what you’ll buy. You didn’t think you were better than either, did you? I mean, hell, your trading app is a publicly traded company: we bet on your bets and guess your winnings and there’s a margin of error, but it’s just that: marginal. You’re already baked in, like the raisins in grandma’s shitty bundt cake.”","“Then how come you were wrong about me?” Abernath’s vision was blurring again. His chest was racing. Abernath had metamorphosed from an object of jealousy into one of anger. Ed didn’t like being made to feel small. His breathing quickened. His chest felt too contained for the rapid beating of his heart.","“Well, there’s that 3%, of course, but I’ve been harboring a private theory – look, you can be my first case study if you want – that we’ve overadapted to entropy at the expense of synchronicity. It’s an old concept people insist on mysticizing, but the point is we model well for chaos, moments where everything breaks, less so for moments where everything suddenly comes together just cause . The miracle for you, it turns out, is that you were making all the right moves for all the wrong reasons. Long enough time horizon, you’ll lose everything. I mean, unless you get really lucky with that leveraged short position on macrochips you might lose it all this week, if you don’t stop, but still. Gotta talk to our quants about that.”","Ed’s vision did not occlude, but it did begin to shake. His fists clenched hard at his sides. Abernath’s smug nonchalance infuriated him. A small buzz from Luna came through in his overlays.","Been there awhile. Omg, are they loving you?","Luna’s kindness pushed him over some kind of sheer cliff face. She believed in him, and it would be his job to break the news of his own failure – no, failure would have meant he had ever even had a chance to mess everything up – his tautological, predefined uselessness. Abernath, in that moment, was no longer human to Ed. He was a manifestation, a chimeric representative, a Frankensteined digit, of the two tremendous writhing forces that prescribed his life.","Ed dove toward Abernath, and the instant he did, the Zoo took his senses from him. He fell through the air, vision and touch and smell restoring just a moment later as he spun to face the room again. It was empty. Or, it appeared empty. Every inch of absence hummed. He felt, in the frightening loneliness, as if his outburst had locked him into both those monstrous contraptions.","The false Ed – ruined and jealous and so banal that his brief shimmer of success had been nothing more than happy accidents in the truest sense – had condensed from the vapors of its dislocated systems and possessed his body. Or, no. It was worse. It had simply proved itself coextensive with him. There was no retrofit, no possession, nothing but the simple fact of its correctness, its complete exchangeability with him.","An invisible hand clasped upon his shoulder. He knew it was Abernath, but also knew that any twitch would remove his senses completely, like it had before. He relaxed, acquiesced to the hand, to the Zoo, and both receded. Abernath fizzed into view. Two security drones moved in from the door, but a gesture from Abernath paused them. Ed found himself laughing uncontrollably. Were they really drones or were they tall men he’d envy? That question would loom over him forever, now. Heavy as an anchor but completely inexplicable, even – no, especially – to Luna.","He let them take him. He turned at the doorway, and Abernath was already talking to someone else on the phone. Outside, it was a bright sunny day. Everywhere he looked, industry hummed, people walked, robots sauntered, and Ed sat on the hot concrete and began to cry."],"tags":[]},{"id":61,"title":"Consensus Nightmares","subtitle":"Issue #59: Three scary stories to tell onchain","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: The maxim ‘code is law’ promises to protect good intentions from abuse and fallibility.

A city run entirely onchain, its architects dreamed of a metropolis without councils, appeal boards, or override keys. Anywhere human corruption or bias could creep in, the chain would rule. Thin, straightforward rules that ran without exception. Every system – housing, identity, even life and death – was arbitrated by smart contracts and oracle relays. What follows are records from that experiment: episodes where the code held firm, where design held steady, and people broke.","All Gelvin ever wanted was to be useful. Useful to his wife Aili, who sat, stone-faced by his useless side. Useful to his children, who were sniffling at the foot of his hospital bed. Useful to his city, where he’d worked for years as a Protocol Clerk, recording civic smart contracts on the city’s chain.","This, Aili thought, was perhaps the hardest part of his coma, knowing it had severed his body from his self-proclaimed purpose. Almost a year ago, now – had it really been so long already? – he had stirred before her and left their bed to shower. She woke, hazily, to the faint sound of dripping water, seconds before a thud shot her out of bed. In the bathroom, she saw him, a strewn towel of a man on the floor, bleeding from his head, muttering the word “three” over and over again.","An hour later, a surgeon was telling her that if she did not agree to surgery, he would die. Ischemic, hemorrhagic, words that had an air of “shouldn’t-we-have-eliminated-such-ghastly-biological-failings-by-now” about them. Words that hung, miasmic as she waited for the surgeon’s professional sad face. When she got it, it didn’t hurt any less for having annticipated its coming. He wasn’t alive, but he wasn’t dead either. He was non-responsive .","They spent the first two months with him in the hospital almost every hour of the day, until a social worker and a doctor sat them down and explained that, if he hadn’t woken up by now, the odds that he would were so infinitesimal as to be non-existent. They should try to “live on,” as the social worker said.","For the most part, they did. Their son Bream went back to college, studying Consensus Engineering. Their daughter Mea back to her career as a Token Compliance Officer. Aili back home. It was an empty place without Gelvin, but she still tried to remember him – she poured two cups of warm sake, always; set the table for them both but only filled one plate; put on his favorite podcast to fall asleep.","She spent an hour every week reviewing his proof-of-liveness signals – scratching at her own implant site while she reviewed her husband’s signals She’d pull up their family’s blockchain dashboard. The center of their lives in Chainpoint, the portal surfaced the smart contracts bound to each of their identity keys: their property deeds, transit entitlements, medical coverage, and the voting keys used for elections and weather decisions.","She scrolled through Gelvin’s feed. Every implant was supposed to emit a cyclical set of liveness proofs: cryptographic challenge-response handshakes with the hospital’s validators, spikes showing voluntary movement, pulse and temperature readings, even tiny flashes of light and microvibrations sent through the implant like a doctor tapping a knee to check reflexes. For 364 days straight, the logs had been blank where valid responses should be.","LIVENESS_CHECK: FAIL – no motion.","LIVENESS_CHECK: FAIL – no response to challenge.","LIVENESS_CHECK: FAIL – biometric flatline.","Chainpoint’s registry allowed no grace periods or exceptions. At 365 consecutive failures, the contract would execute automatically, flipping his status from [ ALIVE ] to [ DECEASED ].","Aili knew this end was coming. Knew, even, that it would be what Gelvin wanted. His will, a smart contract, had special provisions for a “clean death” like this. They’d harvest his organs so his wife and two children would get the money they deserved, but that he’d never been able to save during his life. His death would mean something. Aili didn’t care. She’d be destitute forever if it meant feeling her husband’s early morning stubble against her shoulder again.","The three living Rezniks gathered together in the hospital on the 365th day of his coma. When the final suite of liveness attestations failed, the oracle relays confirmed null signals. His family watched his dashboard profile fade into gray. The miniscule assets that hadn’t been drained by his hospital stay began filtering into their accounts.","Behind the visualizations on the dashboard, a cold dance began. His identity registry contract flipped his status to [ DECEASED ], and the network spread the update like news passed along a chain of neighbors until every corner of the city believed it. The inheritance contract emitted execution events; oracle relays dispatched the organ-harvesting drones, routing them to his registered GPS coordinators. Property claims were disbursed along predefined routes. Health coverage contracts terminated. On the chain, he was already a corpse.","In the hospital, under the antiseptic lights and the doctor’s tired eyes, his heart still beat and his lungs still filled as the various medical machines that surrounded him kept him alive for a few more moments. Watching his death render digitally felt like someone reaching into her sternum and squeezing her heart with their bare hands. She nodded at the doctor, and he took Gelvin off life support. They held their hands and waited for the flatline.","His heart kept beating. After a long and pregnant pause, he inhaled sharply, his eyes shot open, and the doctor took a step back. Suddenly, the room filled with nurses, doctors, and new machines wheeled in hurriedly. Aili and her children heard words like “miracle” and “impossible” as they pushed through the throng to reach him.","When they did, he was blinking. He could not speak or stand. Even if the stroke hadn’t likely paralyzed half his body, a year of disuse has atrophied the rest. But he was alive . He held them in his arms as they draped across him. He winced slightly beneath their weight, but it was hard to notice beneath his smile. He was alive. His family cried. Aili explained that he’d been gone for a year, and even if he couldn’t understand her, he nodded.","A notification sounded from their son’s tablet and his pale face, tight with panic, pulled them from their ecstasy. The chime announced the drones’ approach. Joy soured instantly on all their tongues, turning copper with fear. The hustle of the room slowed, too. Nurses filtered out with their heads down.","“Aren’t his biometrics emitting again?” Aili asked.","“There’s no cryptographic binding anymore. Once the system flagged him as dead, his implant signatures are all just rejected. Useless as a key after the lock’s been changed,” Bream responded.","“What do we do, then?” Aili asked.","“Give me that,” Mea said, grabbing the tablet from his hand. “We’ll just nominate a new key. There’s already a clause for damaged implants. We’ll slip this in before the drones get here.”","She bundled everything she had: implant logs and fresh EEG data that showed he was very much still alive. Using the succession clause in his identity contract, she attempted to nominate the new keypair. She drained their family accounts to pay priority gas fees, pushing the transaction urgently into the network’s waiting rooms, the validator mempools. The drones were only minutes away, and every second would count.","Only his original doctor stayed in the room. The family clustered around Gelvin’s side, leaning in to the tablet as if willing the chain to believe their petition. The transaction propagated through the network’s peer-to-peer gossip layer, which would hopefully spread the news to every machine in earshot.","The system spat back a verdict: INVALID_STATE: DECEASED_IDENTITY . Panic crested. Bream punched the tablet, and its screen shattered, shards cutting into his clenched fist. The system hadn’t broken. It was working perfectly. His status had been finalized hours ago, before he woke up. His death was immutably etched into consensus, now. On the chain, resurrection was read as fraud, and the system had been built to prevent that.","Gelvin willed his useless throat to speak, a hoarse whisper finally leaving his lips. It didn’t matter. Nothing in their reality would overrule what the chain had already determined.","“Can’t we shut down the hospital? Stop the drones from getting in? Fork the chain?” Aili begged the doctor.","“The drones have onchain authority. Their firmware only follows the original chain’s signature, hard-wired into their code. Any fork would be invisible. And we can’t lock any door they wouldn’t have a key for.”","“There has to be something,” she screamed.","There wasn’t. All this was functioning, as far as the design of their metropolis was concerned, perfectly. The self-executing code, the interminability of the network. Everything was designed to prevent resurrection fraud, creating smooth, safe systems impervious to manipulation. No governance vote or human intervention could override this outcome. No one had thought to design for a medical miracle, and now Gelvin, recently reborn, would die again. When reality and the chain disagreed, the chain brought reality to heel.","The timer reached zero, and the buzzing whirs of drones filled the room as the window yielded to their authenticated keys. The doctor and three nurses had to pull Aili, Mea, and Bream from the room.","All Gelvin ever wanted was to be useful, and as the drones bored into his writhing body, bones smoking beneath their drills and his family’s accounts filled with the city’s governance-backed stablecoin, he was.","Neeva read the notification three times before she believed it. Her Chainpoint in Repose series had been minted six months ago on a community marketplace and had sat, unseen, for nine lonely months. She thought the series – photographs of the city skyline that she’d fed through a bespoke AI image generator trained on her oil paintings – was some of her finest work. The market had been indifferent. Until today.","LUTH_EXCELSIOR paid a sizable amount of stablecoin to purchase one of the minted NFT images: the city at night, lights from bustling windows bouncing off the smooth edges of the river and smearing into the sky. The money hit her account immediately. She bragged to everyone at the small office where she worked as a Proof-of-Humanity attestor. The pay there was minuscule, but so were career prospects for art graduates, and her low-income apartment complex was rent-controlled, so she “got by.”","Her coworkers celebrated with her that night. Bleary, intoxicated smiles, jealous glances dotting the evening. Outside, she looked up at the evening skyline that would help pay for the next four months of rent. A little drunk, she stumbled out of the elevator and held her phone against the door, waiting for the familiar click. Instead, the lock held. A “suspended” notice flashed on the door’s electronic handle. She pulled up her dashboard on her phone and navigated to her rental NFT.","Income Status: Over Income Treshhold (+2.9%).","Tenancy NFT State: Flagged, Suspended.","Notice: Access credentials provisionally revoked. Termination event scheduled for Block #13,442,221.","Note: Billing obligations will remain active until termination finalizes onchain. All rent streams continue until the tenancy NFT is formally burned.","Current State: Block #13,442,221 – Pending Finalization.","She hadn’t thought the income from her art would be counted, but of course it was. Everything in Chainpoint was linked: her identity mirrored onchain in perfect symmetry with her real-world life. She thought it unfair. She hadn’t gotten a new job. They hadn’t even given her 30 days to move out and find a new place. The system, of course, did not care. She called her coworker Libby, told her she was locked out, and slept on her couch for the night.","In the morning, she woke, groggy and homeless, to a push notification from her dashboard.","Rent Payment Processed – Thank you!","Hope woke her quickly. She thanked Libby with a breezy kiss on the cheek and sprinted back to her apartment.","Confused, she checked her dashboard. The billing contract was still marked “active.” The tenancy read “pending finalization.” She tried to submit a dispute ticket, but the dashboard spat back an error message: “cannot process disputes until termination finalizes.” Panic rose in her throat, like she was choking on pieces of glass as she clicked dispute again and again.","The address of a tenant advocacy kiosk popped up after the seventh error message, and she went directly there. Flickering fluorescent lights, walls lined with old monitors streaming the block explorer, and a man whose wet eyes never rose from his phone awaited her.","She slammed her hand down on the desk.","“Why am I locked out and still paying?”","“Oh yeah, seen this before.” His tone flat. “Access runs on the fast chain, so it can respond in milliseconds, not hours. Billing lives on a cheaper, slower chain. Safer, auditable, etcetera. They’re usually synced pretty seamlessly, but when the cross-chain bridges jam, they hit total divergence.”","“Why aren’t they communicating, then?”","He had not looked up from his phone or met her eyes. The grey walls seemed to oscillate as if she were inside some mindless creature’s peristaltic stomach. “It won’t stop charging you until the block finalizes. Let me see. Yep. 13,442,221’s frozen.”","If he’d look at her, maybe he’d understand. He did not.","“Massive power outage hit a couple of validator datacenters last week. Whole racks went dark, so the chain stopped. Not much you can do about that, right?”","She caught a glimpse of solitaire cards shuffling on his screen reflecting off his glistening eyes.","“But the power’s back now.”","He shrugged. “Doesn’t matter. When it came back up, half the machines had one version of the block, half the other. It reads like a fork, right? None of ‘em could agree on which was right, so it froze. Once consensus splits, the block’s stuck. Access is revoked, billing still thinks you’re active. You’re caught between the two until someone higher up decides to step in. Which they won’t.”","Neeva’s voice cracked. “So I’m just screwed?”","“To the protocol, you’re just a rounding error. It doesn’t see losers. It sees state. You know what they say, right? Immutability is fairness. Honestly, you should be keeping a closer eye on your finances if you’re mooching off a rent-controlled complex, like this. Next!”","A man twice her size shouldered past her and sidled up to the clerk with his own problems. Neeva stood, numb, for a minute before leaving. The knot in her stomach twisted. Outside, the sun shone too brightly, the buildings stood too tall, and she felt the world wrapping itself around her like a python. A news ticker scrolled along the side of a transit hub: “Validator outage resolved, essential services unaffected.”","She resorted to sleeping on Libby’s couch, but after three nights, Libby’s contract automatically started pulling from Neeva’s account, an additional payment to account for the additional “wear and tear” a new occupant caused.","Her balance was being slowly drained, now from both the apartment she couldn’t enter, and the fractional couch payment. Sleeping on a couch meant she was going to work tired and inefficient everyday, too. Her QA KPIs fell below department averages, and when the company onboarded a new AI model that made half her department redundant, she only found out she was fired when she simply couldn’t swipe in one morning.","She pulled up her wallet on her phone. The auto-generated, weekly thank you messages pinged again and again.","She petitioned city councilors, picketed outside her apartment complex until the summer consensus-approved heat drove her off the streets. No one helped her. People were conditioned not to question the workings of such a perfect system.","While watching her balance shrink almost to nothing, Neeva hoped that she’d become eligible once more. If the income that pushed her over was gone, could the registry see that she was broke enough to qualify for her former status again? The dashboard was uneqivocal: Eligibility status locked — Pending Termination . Until Block #13,442,221 finalized, no recalculation could execute.","Libby kicked her off her couch when Neeva’s balance no longer covered the rent increase. Everyone she knew was living contract to contract, hanging on by small fractions of stablecoins. She wandered the streets and slept beneath alcoves. None of the city’s homeless shelters opened to her. Her ledger still showed active rental payments. When her account reached zero, the balance kept accruing, a careless red debt that ballooned malignantly.","Near midnight, restless on a park bench, a notification that another one of her NFTs had sold sparked a second of hope. The system proceeded, taking just a small chunk out of her growing debt, returning her balance to the negatives once more.","Passerbys clicked their smartwatches against her phone, held out in shameful supplication, and the money disappeared into the overdue balance.","Across the plaza, a woman swiped her wrist against the door of a high-rise, and it opened with a cheerful green glow. A man behind her scanned his phone into the subway gate, and the turnstile spun. All around, access flowed smoothly: locks yielded, trains departed, systems sang. Neeva leaned against the wall. Her empty wallet glowed in her palm.","The city had rendered her both tenant and trespasser, solvent and broke. She tried to sleep, but Chainpoint hummed. The city lights smeared into the sky and speared angrily against her closed lids. The city went on around her, ceaseless, perfect, unyielding.","The dam above Ledger Falls held the sunrise like a great concrete catcher’s mitt. Morning smeared pink and orange across its great, wide surface and slid across the town below. The hundreds of homes interspersed between micro-vineyards, hydroponic greenhouses, and sluice gates yawned awake in the early hours. The ambient hum of mining and server farms powered by the abundant hydropower of the dam was gradually dulled by the awakening sounds of industry. Cars wound through the Chainpoint suburb. Toward the top of the all-seeing dam, a small glint of bronze, rusting from disuse, shimmered beneath the sun.","Erected in XX00, Governed by Smart Contract.","This autumn morning, October 3, XX99, a junior researcher named Jeremiah shuffled into his car, a small dribble of coffee straining his white shirt. He drove up the spillway access road into the hydropower substation.","He’d been cataloging actuator logs across the town’s network for three months. Tedious, lonely work. The dam’s safety systems, power routing, and more were all onchain, and these actuators turned the chain’s demands and logics into real-world events: a gate shutting here; waterflow increasing there; charged batteries shipped away. After nearly a century of upgrades and protocol migrations, the billions of onchain actuator logs had drifted across outdated storage layers and helf-deprecated nodes, scattered messily through the network. Jeremiah was continually scanning thousands of inactive, regular pings, that were always the same.","The work was so monotonous that he almost missed two sudden and unfamiliar lines of code:","Why was the system checking actuators? He scrolled through a hundred lines and found that it wasn’t just a couple; it was dozens. He pulled their contract address, assuming it was probably some kind of firmware test, but as the block explorer unrolled an arcane bytecode string, coded the very year the dam went up, his jaw dropped. A crude, immutable condition sat at the base of the stack:","if (block.timestamp >= genesis_time + 100 years) { DEMOLISH(); }","The room went cold, but he felt unbearably hot.","Stumbling outside, he looked down at the town – children biked along the trickle of the damed river outlet – the DEMOLISH command floated like a typographic storm above everything.","He returned to the office and began digging through as many old records as he could find.","Chainpoint Valley HOA – Sales Committee Notes (Nov. 21 XX19), LLM Summary.","Agenda Item: DAO Disclosure Requirements for Prospective Buyers.","Background: The dam’s long-term governance was bound to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) at the time of construction. The contract escrow, a demolition fund, disburses validator rewards to keep its oracle network alive, and hard-codes a covenant requiring the dam’s removal exactly 100 years after block-height zero – an automated guarantee to restore the river in accordance with the original settlement between developers and environmental groups (a compromise for “temporarily unsettling a vital wetland ecosystem”). Demolition shall not commence while Certified Protective Organizations report verified occupancy at demolition sites.","Committee consensus: Explicit reference to this “100-Year Environmental Demolition Covenant” in the DAO charter is detrimental to property values.","Motion proposed: Minimize disclosure, replacing references with vague “future governance review” language in deeds.","Developers’ view: By the time the demolition clause matures, blockchains will be obsolete or upgraded; consensus networks rarely last a decade, much less a century.","Legal counsel: Courts unlikely to enforce protocols literally; “code is law” is a slogan, not precedent.","Resolution: Effective immediately, all HOA communications will omit mention of the covenant. Sales packets will stress perpetual water security and multi-generational growth opportunities.","Jeremiah’s binder overflowed lines of code and summaries of the actuator network. Blueprints revealed the dam had been seeded with conduits and cavities for demolition charges, each mapped to addressable detonators. For a century, they’d sat inert, but the wiring was there, waiting. Jeremiah tracked the knowledge of the demolition clause slowly receding from memory. Not one single censorious instance, but a thousand micro-decisions and self-interested assumptions. The Chainpoint network hadn’t degraded. The escrow accounts hadn’t dried up or been inflated out of existence. The town had only weeks before it would be destroyed.","Desperate, he’d fumbled through a speech at a recent town hall. He was a researcher, not a public speaker, and most read the very real panic in his voice as unhinged, except for one of the ombudsmen named Clara and a community college professor named Leon, who both found him after the town hall and asked to look over his work.","Once they had, panic wracked their frames. The three wasted a week trying to prompt widescale evacuations, before realizing that any such campaign would need years, not weeks. They’d convinced a few people, but to most, they sounded like protestors waving “THE END IS NIGH” signs.","They turned their efforts toward the DAO itself. Leon recruited his students, promising a perfect grade if they helped him. He studied the DAO contract and proposed physically forking the river upstream of the dam, then redefining the new outflow as the river itself. The DAO would check for the river and find it flowing freely, and the demolition commands would be skipped. Leon and his students dug channels and slowly diverted the river while they wrote up municipal paperwork for the renaming. The approval came through a week before the scheduled demolition. The small crowd cheered as a small trickle of water flowed through the alternate river. Jeremiah shook his head as the actuator logs flashed.","The name changes, the deeds, the flow-monitors, none of it had mattered. The DAO oracles checked GPS coordinates against a fixed set that had been defined at commissioning. The dam’s “truth” was locked to those coordinates. It didn’t care about Leon’s river at all.","Clara focused on the chain itself. A fork on the chain, a new one without the demolition command, rather than the physical river, Clara explained, would work as if the river had met a sudden split in the land. The ledger’d keep flowing, but now there would be two versions of history moving side by side. Eventually, only one would be recognized as the “real” river. She’d make it hers. She wrote a “starting document” with a new network ID that patched the demolition line so it would never fire. She door-knocked to borrow neighbors’ computers and hired a validator firm that she, Leon and Jeremiah, drained their wallets to pay for. Since the original DAO had been mostly forgotten, it shouldn’t take much to make her new channel the more popular one.","Mere days before the demolition, the forked chain was ready to be pushed into the network. The dashboard on her laptop confirmed the signed validators. She broadcast the fork’s headers directly to the dam gateway through a relay node, and they all held their breaths, tied together with electric hope. She entered the PUBLISH_HEADERS command, and the entire group let loose a cheer when Clara’s monitor flashed a peaceful green message:","Jeremiah paused from his celebration to look at the actuator logs.","The dam’s actuators would only accept headers signed by the original chain’s genesis ID. He lifted his head to break the news, but he didn’t have to. A tremendous shudder shook the ground beneath their feet. Intake gates screamed open, shedding decades of rust as they spun. Reservoir water roared, preparing for the coming deluge.","Clara refused failure. If they couldn’t change the code, she’d spoof the infrastructure itself. She wouldn’t attack history, but the present. Clara found the protest clause nestled in Jeremiah’s notes. Certified protestors could not be harmed by the demolition charges themselves, language insisted upon by the eco-groups to protect their future bargaining power and to adhere to safety protocols.","The same environmental groups had once chained themselves to trees to prevent loggers from felling forests. In the hours before the demolition was scheduled, Leon, a few of his more courageous students, Clara, and her partner walked to the blasting joints within the dam’s structure and locked themselves into the housings. They chained themselves together: faces illuminated with headlamps, sensors draped across their wrists, and fed their proof of protest to the DAO. They insisted Jeremiah stay behind in case they failed, but he watched the video stream and ensured the data moved correctly across the chain. They sang the Chainpoint High School football team’s song together, further asserting their presence.","Jeremiah stared nervously at the actuator logs, waiting for the disarming key to populate. The group’s presence appeared. Lines of code acknowledging their existence ended with:","Jeremiah fell to his knees along the riverbank above Chainpoint. The code had been written to protect groups, not humans themselves. They’d misunderstood the immutable logic the dam was built on. Their presence was only half the solution. Without attested credentials, they were not a group of protestors. To the oracle layer, they were just noise.","The dam groaned as the flow increased, readying for demolition. On the small video feed, their song faltered, voices crackling with fear. Jeremiah tried to push through a last-minute authorization, categorizing the group, but without funds left to pay the gas fees, the registration stalled in the mempool. There wasn’t enough time.","The town was small beneath him. An empty, single siren, the last surviving piece of alarm hardware that hadn’t been renovated out of existence, rang in the town’s center. The protestors inside the dam began to scream, some hurriedly tried to unchain themselves, but it didn’t matter. A tremendous crack sounded from the dam and the video feeds all failed. Their sensors went dark, Flashes of white light raced across the dam wall. It all came crumbling down. A concrete dehiscence. The river’s flow a bloody deluge that careened from the once placid cliff down over the town.","Houses and people and pets and schools and cars and screams were all swallowed in a single rushing wave that left nothing but the noonday sun bouncing off its glimmering surface. Thousands of homes, even more humans, all gone in an instant. No one above spoke. Few dared breathe above the devastation.","On Jeremiah’s monitor, a final output line appeared:","DAO_EXECUTION: SUCCESS – Contract closed.","The Chainpoint wetlands caught the noonday sun and held it like a beach ball in the winding, wet fields. Jeremiah stood above it all, silent, spent, and useless.","The Special Interest Group on Protocol Fiction (SIGPF) is a bi-weekly group that will meet every other Thursday, 10:00 to 11:00 am EST starting Thursday, October 23rd .

Summer of Protocols and FUTURX will host a meetup in Buenos Aires on November 19th. RSVP here . Also – check out the new non-fiction essay bounties on Discord .","Unlike most previous technological disruptions, generative artificial intelligence (genAI) has an exceptionally low barrier to entry. Anyone with internet access and basic language skills can now generate content in the form of text, images, audio, and video. This accessibility explains both its extraordinary speed of adoption and its deep impact on the cultural and creative industries – sectors whose raw material is content but whose primary product is meaning.","From my experience researching and working on the impact of genAI in cultural and creative ecosystems over the past three years, two paths continually intersect.","On one path, there are long-term questions around creativity, the datasets used to train models, copyright reform, and the future of creative labor.","On the other, there are urgent implementation challenges: projects and organizations must adopt these tools to remain relevant, yet doing so ethically demands shared principles and clear agreements among those who use them.","This text stems from FUTURX’s panel Protocols for a Critical Use of AI in Cultural Projects, organized with UNESCO, on August 20, 2025.","Our aim is to stoke the debate around one of the most pressing challenges in the cultural field today: how to design frameworks and protocols that make it easier for people to do the right thing – to use genAI tools to enrich their art and culture without fear, by managing negative side effects such as opacity, bias, or data misuse.","An initial guiding question is:","What should a cultural project or organization do when faced with a high-impact technology like genAI? How – and for what purpose – should it be integrated?","To respond, we propose three starting points:","Build a shared understanding of what critical use of genAI entails.","Recognize the areas where genAI has the greatest impact on cultural projects and organizations.","Embrace the notion of protocols as a fundamental tool to address common challenges posed by technological change.","There is a long history of tensions between technology and culture. Technological paradigm shifts require processes of adaptation in which many established practices need to transform. In this sense, the capacity of genAI to produce text, image, audio, and video from pre-existing content datasets once again challenges creative and artistic practices.","Platforms like SUNO – currently the leading generative music platform, producing more than one million songs per day – claim in their article The Future of Music that they train their models with “all the music available on the internet,” just as any individual could. By contrast, many cultural voices argue that this practice is neither ethical nor transparent, calling for state regulation of the use of cultural content in training datasets.","These debates will not be resolved overnight. While legislation is still under discussion in much of the world, we can gain both time and sovereignty if we focus on how these models could adapt to our practices – instead of adapting our practices to the models.","From here, several important questions emerge:","Where do we draw ethical boundaries in creation, reception, analysis, and communication when using content generated wholly or partially with genAI?","How do we protect culture from being included in training datasets without consent? And what possibilities emerge if we stop thinking of genAI solely as a tool and begin to approach it as a cultural, political, and economic system?","What kinds of collective agreements could we imagine so that we can decide – together – how to use the technology?","Protocols appear as one possible answer: engineered arguments that enable cultural projects to structure the relationship between content and technology. The cultural sector needs its own frameworks – dynamic and adaptable – capable of sustaining trust among peers and communities. Protocols can serve as a shared compass to decide which data we use, how we label it, how we guarantee transparency, and which ethical boundaries we do not want to cross.","We are not starting from scratch. UNESCO has already established key references: the 2005 Convention frames culture as a crucial dimension of sustainable development, and the 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence offers globally accepted values, principles, and policy guidelines.","At FUTURX we have begun translating these ideas into practice through research and collective experimentation, developing frameworks and tools to help cultural organizations navigate the ethical and creative challenges of AI.","As I mentioned at the beginning, what makes genAI truly disruptive is its low barrier to entry. This accessibility democratizes creation, but also multiplies ethical, aesthetic, and social challenges that we are only beginning to grasp.","The problem is that, in most cases, these tools do not guarantee many of the basic requirements a new piece of content should meet: knowing the source and reliability of the information it contains, ensuring transparency, and making sure it is ethical and appropriate for the intended use.","We consider the critical use of this technology to be conscious, reflective, and ethical. This mainly implies:","Analyzing information or content generated by AI, since it may be biased or incorrect.","Maintaining an ethical stance, protecting authorship, cultural diversity, and property.","Preserving our autonomy and vision; using genAI as an ally.","In short, within culture and creativity, critical use means that AI should not dictate the outcome, but rather expand our possibilities – always under our gaze and responsibility.","How does a philosophy of critical use translate into creative and cultural practice? What protocols can we extract from real experiences to guide our practices?","Based on our research and collaborations with different cultural institutions, we have identified a few key considerations:","The distinction between experimental and commercial uses (where clear clauses and traceability are necessary).","The need to align models with values of openness and rights.","The urgency of working with diverse data and metadata to avoid bias.","The value of critical prototyping as a methodology that accepts error and allows us to open the black box of algorithms.","These points show that protocols are not abstract rules, but situated guides that can help orient how we experiment, produce, and distribute culture in an environment dominated by opaque systems.","After understanding the tensions and needs that arise when aiming for a critical use of genAI, the next step is to look closely at the areas where this technology has the greatest impact on cultural projects and organizations.","Today, trust between peers – whether individuals or projects, within the same organization or across different ones – is facing a crisis due to the lack of transparency, traceability, and the inappropriate use of platforms.","We have identified five key points of interaction between genAI and cultural projects. For each one, we outline a guiding question and suggest an initial protocol.","Guiding question: How can we create mechanisms of trust when works or proposals produced using genAI arrive at an organization or project, where simple prohibition of these tools is not the solution?","Protocol suggestion: The key is knowing how these tools were involved. A simple step is to ask participants to declare it. This transparency opens up the process without diminishing authorship.","Example: A public fund that includes in its application form the question: “Did you use genAI in this process or for the idea you submitted? Please describe how.”","2. Creation of New Content","Guiding question: When organizations produce with AI, how can we ensure accountability?","Protocol suggestion: What matters is leaving a trace: which prompts were used, what decisions were made, how humans and models were combined. This traceability helps explain where a piece comes from and recognize different contributions.","Example: A museum that publishes a visual piece created with AI and specifies on the exhibit label which model was used and the role of the curators.","3. Analysis of Archives and Databases","Guiding question: How do we avoid erasing memories or exposing sensitive data when using genAI to analyze collections?","Protocol suggestion: genAI can organize archives, but it can also obscure histories or leak private information. That’s why it is crucial to review the outputs, safeguard privacy, and ensure proper context before dissemination.","Example: A film archive that digitizes its collection with genAI, but validates each description with specialists before publishing it.","4. Communication with Audiences and Peers","Guiding question: How do we preserve trust when interacting with audiences using genAI tools?","Protocol suggestion: Automated responses can improve efficiency, but relationships with audiences require transparency. It should always be clear when a machine is speaking and when a person is, and a human channel must always remain available.","Example: A record label that uses genAI to draft email responses but has a team review and approve them before sending.","5. Protection and Cultural Diversity","Guiding question: How can we prevent genAI from reproducing biases and erasing singularities?","Protocol suggestion: If left unchecked, models tend to replicate biases and flatten diversity. Incorporating situated datasets and specific metadata is not a technical detail – it is a way of expanding cultural diversity instead of reducing it.","Example: A community archive that becomes a dataset to train a model highlighting local languages or cultural expressions.","Can we imagine minimal, grounded applications of these protocols?","A culturally responsible use of genAI begins with a techno-realist mindset – one that acknowledges the non-neutrality of technology and reclaims the right to shape it according to our own contexts, values, and imaginaries. The cultural field has the power to design its own tools, languages, and agreements instead of adapting passively to corporate ones.","These protocols will not only help us work better; they will help us build the new codes of trust we need to use this technology ethically and collaboratively. What we need are not grand declarations, but small, situated actions—shared practices that make ethical use tangible in everyday life. This is an open invitation: for artists, institutions, and communities to act as system designers, building a culture with genAI that is responsible, sustainable, and radically human."],"tags":["Liked by Protocolized"]},{"id":63,"title":"Jobs","subtitle":"","author":"Unknown","content":["There are no open positions at the moment.

We meet every other week for an hour to break down a case study or business reading, usually with the goal of improving our own work – or improving how we think about current affairs. Join here .","Last week, two SIGP4B contributors, Rafael and Sachin , hosted a workshop on AI adoption curves. What will the next 30 years look like, really? In this post I’ll share a few key insights from the workshop, including key readings and case studies that informed it, then preview two special projects booting up at Summer of Protocols.","Context: a two-part, futures workshop exploring how Europe could produce a region-specific AI over 30 years, moving through Levels 1–5 of SIGP4B’s Capability Maturity Model .","In the first session, blue teams went stage by stage, designing adopting strategies. Scenarios matured from early uncontrolled usage of LLMs to companies redesigned around AI-assisted workflows. Red teams fought back with crises, tensions, and governance issues – ending with a last-minute disruption event to force adaptivity.","In the second session, participants refactored their 30-year roadmaps into stories. That’s hard to write a story about. Roadmaps and protocols aren’t inherently exciting, but they’re important. Thanks to Protocolized and its writers, we’ve gotten good at coaching others in writing protocol fiction – so protocol designers can make more impact.","Broken down and summarized for easier reading.

A brief written by hand for 8 hours isn’t equal to one generated in 8 minutes; critique can be more direct for generated output – people feel less attached to their work.","Red herring metrics: Token counts and total spend are not-even-wrong.

A computer scientist is a device that turns coffee into papers. What can happen, and perhaps more importantly, cannot or should not happen, when you connect the two devices?","That’s the whimsical premise of a paper we read as part of a track of discussions on process calculi , curated by Patrick Nast , co-host with me of SIGFPT, the Special Interest Group in Formal Protocol Theory , which meets every other Friday at 10AM Pacific (1700 UTC) on our Discord . The next call is this Friday, 17th, where we’ll be discussing “motion languages” developed in robotics, based on a formalism known as maneuver automata , and how they might be used to describe protocols. If these sorts of discussions interest you, join us!","If it sounds like we’re casting a wide net here, it’s because we are. The challenge of modeling and analyzing protocols in the broadest sense is a daunting one, and we’re still in discovery/cartography mode, four months in, gathering tools, techniques, and motivating examples from all over the place. Since my previous update ( What is Formal Protocol Theory , August 20), things have been moving along briskly.","While the material we tackle can sometimes be intimidatingly mathematical, don’t let that scare you off! We make aggressive use of LLM ELI5ing, toy examples, paper-napkin diagramming, and simple back-of-envelope calculations, to make our discussions accessible even to participants from pure humanities backgrounds.","Whatever your technical aptitudes, there’s never been a better time to vibe-math your way into previously inaccessible territories. All you need is curiosity and irreverence.","A major highlight of the last eight weeks was the Protocol Foundations Workshop held in September. Around 30+ interested folks from a variety of technical and non-technical backgrounds gathered over four Zoom sessions across two days, with brisk activity in-between the sessions on our Discord, to map out the contours of this emerging field.","We had some pretty intense and wide-ranging lightning talk sessions (see screenshot below from our Roam graph for a sense of the proceedings), and then attempted to synthesize the discussions into a coherent map of the territory, and an agenda for continuing discussions and work.","One of the follow-through activities that has shaped up since the workshop is a collaborative effort to write a “tan paper” (our term for something between a non-technical white paper and a technical yellow paper), laying out a roadmap for research in formal protocol theory. This effort is just getting started, and will likely unfold over the next few months. So if you’re interested in contributing, this would be a good time to jump in. If our cunning plans unfold as we hope, this tan paper will lay the groundwork and define the agenda for an exciting new technical field, and trigger a flood of new research and technical tooling.","Currently, the project is shaping up to take a “protocol failure and repair” view of the domain, and adopt something like a bridge perspective between engineering and sociological perspectives.","We will also draw from older fields like cybernetics, systems theory, science and technology studies (STS) and institutionalism, while remaining oriented towards the defining “true north” elements of protocol theory – observability, verifiability, temporality, tight grounding in empiricism, and real infrastructures – that are often under-theorized in adjacent fields. We hope to outline a “basket of protocols” approach to formalization, in terms of scoping-in both a wide range of protocols (from handshakes and traffic to blockchains, AI regulation, and climate), and in terms of tools and frameworks.","Some of the “ingredients” that might show up in the paper:","It’s still very early in the process, so we don’t quite know where this will end up, so if you’re impatient to learn more, you’ll just have to attend our sessions.","Reviewing the progress of our study group got me thinking about why getting this field going matters in 2025, and it struck me that the biggest reason is to develop an expansive and holistic view of technological society that is in some sense the natural antithesis to the one offered by the ascendant AI view.","If you’ll excuse an outrageously mixed metaphor, AI is the irresistible force eating everything, while protocols, especially modern computationally mediated ones, are emerging as the immovable objects that absolutely resist being eaten.","So FPT, in some ways, can be understood as the “Evil Twin” field of AI – the art and science of designing “immovable” objects. While I normally dislike negative and reactive definitions, in this case it’s not only a very fertile framing, but a poetically appropriate one. And it casts everything we’ve been doing in SIGFPT in a very interesting light.","An evil twin, unlike a nemesis, isn’t a true antipode. What makes for an interesting pair of evil twins is an unsettling combination of extreme similarity and extreme dissimilarity between two entities. The extreme similarities, in this case, are fairly obvious. Both AI and protocols, for example, play a role in “automation” of human functions. Both generate and govern complex behaviors. In typical modern examples, both rely on, and compete over, sophisticated computing capabilities. Both require complex human interfaces and attention to safety. Many actual engineered artifacts necessarily involve both AI and protocol design philosophies (including modern AIs themselves – protocols feature in the training recipes, “alignment” recipes, in the design of guardrails hard and soft, and in the interconnection fabrics of distributed AIs).","But it is the “evil” oppositions that are interesting, especially theoretically, and it’s easiest to see this in terms of the two defining qualities of the “AI view” of technological society: intelligence and agency, which increasingly suffuse everything around us.","“Intelligence,” however you define or design it, tends to make everything it touches fluid, contingent, ambiguous, unstable, and malleable. Intelligence “oozes” everywhere, and into everything, through the tiniest pores. Which is as it should be. That is the great power of intelligence, at once enlivening and corrosive – to root everything in a foundation of systematic doubt; to make it certain that nothing is certain. Everything is subject to movement and change once intelligent attention is directed at it.","The other dimension of AI is agency, the quality in behavior that lends it a restless, proactive, intentional character. A quality that causes endless change and becoming; that leads to willfully transforming and being transformed; that insists on nudging what is towards what could be . That is constantly drawn to the adjacent possible.","What happens when you flip these two qualities? What do you get when you try to deliberately construct something both anti-intelligent and anti-agentic? You get protocols!","Protocols are often deliberately designed to be “dumb,” even if the component elements are the same kinds of very powerful computers that run AI models, and must be artificially dumbed down to serve their functions. Protocols lock in commitments, rigidly constrain behavior, and implacably resist the oozy qualities of intelligence with hardness, immutability, and rigidity. With immovability.","Agency is subtler. In the world of AI, proactive, goal-directed, intentional behavior, within an evolving space of high optionality, is a highly desirable capability in all machines. In the world of protocols, the goal is usually to restrict the range of options, and limit autonomy in goal-directed behaviors. Not only do protocols themselves usually not have “goals” as such (an early finding from our research), they actively constrain the agency of actors operating within their confines, through both designed “artificial nature” type laws that cannot be broken, and incentives that reward or punish to constrain unbridled agency in softer ways.","To borrow a pair of terms from the postmodernists, protocols turn smooth behavior spaces (such as open, unbuilt terrain) into striated behavior spaces (such as a system of roads).","If the modern mantra of AI-inspired “agentic” culture is you can just do things, a mantra for protocol-inspired culture might be fish can’t see water, following David Foster Wallace’s famous speech, This is Water . The holy grail of protocols is perhaps cultural and technological design that silently, inscrutably, and immovably prevents specific classes of actions, to the point where you cannot even conceive of the possibility of going “against protocol.”","HAL 9000, the primary antagonist in 2001: A Space Odyssey, usually thought of as an AI, is perhaps better thought of as a supple intelligence wrapped around an immovable protocol. After all, its most memorable line was I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that.","Blockchains, the original motivating class of protocols behind this magazine and the Summer of Protocols programs, illustrate the evil-twin character most clearly, with their “code is law” design premise, which brings a cryptographically secured doomsday-machine character to more fluid human understandings of law, incomplete contracting, sovereign exception-making and so forth. The immutability of blockchains, it appears, can not only resist randomness, humans, and AIs, it might even resist future quantum computers.","Many criticized the earliest blockchain, Bitcoin, based on “Proof of Work,” for embodying willfully engineered stupidity, designed to convert fossil-fuel joules into the most “useless” conceivable computations. Within the crypto world however, Ethereum is, rather remarkably, criticized for shifting to a “Proof of Stake” system precisely because it is not dumb enough, allowing for (according to the criticism) insufficient rigidity of behavior. For being too useful in some sense (Proof of Stake embodies the sociology of stakes in a system in legible, manipulable ways while Proof of Work doesn’t embody anything beyond computation for the sake of computation, useless by design).","To make matters worse, Ethereum’s vision of a “world computer” (Ethereum is a Turing-complete computer, unlike Bitcoin, which deliberately avoids being Turing-complete), is viewed by many as being against the true spirit of blockchains. Too close for comfort to the “irresistible force” side of the dichotomy. Too simpatico with AI for a self-respecting protocol. Still, overall, Ethereum falls on the protocol side of the fence – more immovable object than irresistible force.","The dichotomy runs even deeper. Zero-knowledge proof technology, increasingly a mainstay of blockchains, is being increasingly recognized as the apotheosis of “AI resistance” in a mathematical sense. Many schemes and proposals for governing AI systems rely on the remarkable properties of ZK systems.","The deliberately anti-intelligent, anti-agentic character of protocols is not limited to blockchains of course. It is also evident in much simpler technologies, such as coffee machines. Many ordinary artifacts are made as dumb and rigid as possible for a variety of reasons, the most important being stability of technologically embodied commitments, and determinism and predictability in generated behavior.","An area where this tension between intelligence and anti-intelligence is particularly evident, and rapidly coming to a head, is robotics. Classical robotics, in domains like factory automation, aims to enable and embody highly controllable, verifiable, and deterministic behaviors. The very word robot is etymologically derived from the Czech “robota” for forced labor or drudgery. Until quite recently, “robotic” in English was an adjective pointing to rigid, mechanical behaviors, not uncanny machines that dance and perform acrobatics more fluidly than we can.","The pre-AI view of robots was: More expressive and complex than machine tools and traditional automation, but decidedly less expressive and complex – by design – than free humans. By analogy to blockchains, traditional CNC machine tools are rigidly limited by design, like Bitcoin, while traditional robots, like Ethereum, are more expressive and programmable, but still rigidly limited. Both CNC machines and traditional industrial robots are clearly protocol technologies, designed for reliably repeatable and safely constrained behaviors.","Modern robotics though, is drawing deeply from the well of modern AI. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based robots, rather than being designed from first principles starting with physics models and formal control theory, learn more like human babies, thrashing about getting a feel for their bodies, and exploring remarkably weird behavior spaces until they finally learn the (protocolized!) adult modes of movement. Though these pre-theoretical learning trajectories might eventually converge on the same behaviors as formal design techniques, they do so without the need for the scaffolding of elaborate mathematical theories. But, as with babies, they do so with a lot of stumbling and flailing along the way, requiring safe training environments.","The tension is illustrated in a hilarious episode of Futurama , where Bender the robot is puzzled by humans doing an 80s-style robot dance, which he is not robotic enough to imitate.","This tension, incidentally, will be the topic of our call this coming Friday (October 17) – maneuver automata are an old “protocolish” way (from ~2003) of designing robot behaviors that are colliding with the emerging “AI” ways. Future robots that meld the two philosophies elegantly will likely lead to the most powerful robots imaginable. Thesis and antithesis converging in synthesis.","We are studying this in our group because we think very similar dynamics will play out in fields beyond robotics, anywhere AI and protocol ways of thinking and doing collide. Which is everywhere.","For the field of AI, the possibility of pre-theoretical engineering is perhaps its most enticing feature, rather than a bug. You don’t need complicated theories and formalisms! You can just have AIs and robots fuck around and find out (FAFO) like biological organisms do!","Nassim Taleb’s old admonishment – do not attempt to teach birds to fly – now seems to apply not just to birds, but to robotic airplanes and helicopters too. And even to us theorizing creatures, humans! Taken to the limit of absurdity, the stance would be that FAFO all the way down is the only way to exist.","This is not a new idea. Back in 2008, before the birth of modern AI, Chris Anderson, in Wired, wrote the first clear AI-supremacist manifesto along these lines, The End of Theory , arguing that we no longer need theories. We just need tons of data and simple algorithms to chomp through them with massive compute.","It is now becoming clear that people like Anderson, and modern FAFO-maximalists, deeply misunderstand what theories and formalization are for. They are meant to constrain and control, not enable and unleash! They are protocol fuel!","This is a rather wild idea! The point of all theorizing is to discover impossibilities, symmetries, and conserved quantities that can be recruited to create structures that effectively constrain and confine the seemingly unbridled and unstoppable power of intelligence and agency. To lend to engineering some of the dependable inexorability of natural laws. To give intelligence and agency worthy adversaries to try to hack and get around. A great deal of ingenuity, for instance, has historically gone into efforts to make perpetual motion machines, which physics declares to be an impossible task.","Paradoxically, when we are able to find and harness a natural phenomenon that can serve as a hard constraint on certain behaviors, things get more creative, not less, because FAFO energies are more potently focused.  Examples include asymmetric public-key cryptography,(which rests on the intractability of reversing certain mathematical operations), or gravity (which so far, we don’t know how to turn off). Look around. You’ll find that every significant technology in our lives rests on cleverly harnessed impossibilities and limits, configured into scaffoldings that limit rather than enable.","FAFO – the essence of not just AI but any evolutionary process – may help you figure out what you can do, but it takes theorizing to figure out what you cannot do, and use it to shape behaviors around what you should not do. And it takes both elements – unstoppable forces and immovable objects – to build not just technologies, but societies.","For protocols, limits and impossibilities are features, not bugs. The rigidity entailed by formally designed, and rigidly (perhaps unbreakably) constrained behaviors is not just a feature, it is a highly desirable one. So much so that we humans, who historically evolved in the FAFO ways modern AIs do, consciously constrain our own behaviors through elaborately designed “anti-intelligent” social protocols that separate us from our nearest primate cousins, and call this deliberate self-domestication “civilization!”","We do this even when we cannot find suitable natural laws to harness, and are forced to make up arbitrary ones, and rely on less powerful forces than mathematical impossibility, such as guns or burned bridges, to enforce them. Before “code is law,” we had entrenched bureaucracies. Before immutable ledgers, we had inviolable religious doctrines.","Why would you want to design and voluntarily inhabit such anti-intelligent and anti-agentic structures of control and confinement, as humans have been doing since the dawn of civilization? Why might we similarly want to do this to the emerging “wild” ecology of AIs?","The answer is the same in both cases – by bringing a certain predictable order and discipline into unpredictably chaotic intelligent and agentic behaviors, we make it possible to socially scale, coordinate, and commit to actions in much more powerful ways. By giving up a little intelligence and agency at one locus, we gain vastly more of both at another.","And in 2025, we can increasingly do this in strikingly non-arbitrary ways. Indeed, we must do it using the most immutable, immovable phenomena we can find, since the force of AI is the most irresistible ever conjured. Nothing weaker than mathematical inevitability can resist.","Which is why we  think formal protocol theory is such an exciting frontier. If you find this argument compelling and irresistible, you must join us this Friday. Resistance is futile.","There are two new protocol fiction bounties live on our Discord. Cyborgs vs. Rooms and Strange laws of robotics . These bounties operate on hackathon pitching rules. Head over to the #pitches-bounties-workshop thread and read the prompts and guidelines there.

Scientists insist that this does not constitute mourning. Necrophoresis is a sanitization practice, not a religious or spiritual one.","My—our—job is not without precedent. But the events that led me to the library of grief most certainly were.","I sensed the call was different when I was ported up to the digisphere and 10 other undertakers were there waiting for me.","For all of human history, we’ve buried our dead in one way or another, but for most of that time it was an elephantine act filled with grief and sorrow. We were not cleansing the earth of our grandmothers, brothers, and daughters. We were shepherding them to the afterlife and mourning the spaces they left in ours.","In the time-dilated digisphere of Earth-6, death has been erased. At least from view. Thanks to time-dilation, which acts on brain systems I’m not paid enough to understand, and shared virtual embodiment technologies, the vast swaths of humanity who live in virtual environments experience centuries in what would be felt on Earth-1 as minutes. Death doesn’t exist in the digisphere’s villages, cities, and superstates.","Accidents happen. Buildings hosting dilation chambers collapse—mostly due to no one wanting to live in and maintain un-dilated spaces anymore. Aneurysms, heart attacks, even the occasional digital murder. Of course autonomous nanobot construction swarms are supposed to keep things safe and humming. The longevity sciences perfected in dilated research environments have erased many Earth-1 diseases, and medical deaths are far less common now. But still.","I’d been an undertaker for 70 Earth-6 years. I’d cleaned hundreds of dead virtual bodies, floating like AFK users or broken NPCs in lobbies, meadows, and work spaces. Occasionally, if there were other users close to them, witnesses to their passing, I’d perform mind-wipes.","I’d never seen anything like this .","When you live for centuries and no one you know has ever expired, you lose your stomach for death. People don’t recognize what it is, or what it means. Children who have spent their entire conscious existence in dilated digispheres haven’t experienced death as anything other than an unfamiliar artifact from humanity’s distant past.","We entered the hyperlocal villaging sphere. The suburban town was empty and quiet as we walked through, led by visual overlays pointing to “the source of the confusion.”","We entered a large gymnasium that opened into an acres-wide set of fields, tracks, and hiking paths. Another undertaker screamed when he saw them. He was reassigned, ported out almost instantly. We’re not supposed to react to the bodies or death at all. I didn’t blame him though.","Death psychologically ravages digicitizens. Sometimes, when users experience a bodily death, their digital avatars experience it in slow motion. Ants move their dead so the pathogens that killed them, or would form on their dead bodies, do not infect the colony. In digital environments the threat is informetric, memetic, even, but it is real. We’ve had to reset an entire sphere when a local mayor died during a ribbon cutting ceremony in front of 300 users. Death broke something wide open in them we couldn’t fully close. Undertakers are supposed to be stronger than that.","Inside the gymnasium, 33 bodies hovered just inches above the ground. They were not moving, but each was releasing a long, guttural groan from their barely parted lips. Some were glitching, limbs spasmodically jerking. Most were still. They were already dead. Their dilated avatars just hadn’t caught up yet.","None of us moved. It takes a lot to shock an undertaker, but we had never seen this much concentrated death before. Protocols were designed for single-instance deaths, though they were flexible enough to be used for multiples. Once, just once, I was responsible for a couple that had died together simultaneously. I thought that would be the worst of my career. I hadn’t planned on this kind of mass event.","We saw a young child running between the dead bodies, pulling at their sleeves as he cried. Another undertaker turned and ran.","The basic steps of undertaking are simple. When a dead user is identified, we have six hours to remove them. The first two hours are spent locating their particular virtual render and mapping their last five (Earth-6) days. This lets us contact trace and note any erratic pre-death behavior with potential psychosocial fallout.","A couple undertakers swallowed hard and began scanning the bodies, downloading virtuo-spatial and cognitive data. Someone started a contact map and found pretty quickly that this would be more about removal than memory wiping. This remote enclave had little contact with the rest of Earth-6.","No one was acknowledging the small child, though. I didn’t know if the memory wiping tools were strong enough for such trauma. We had never specced something this awful before.","I took the kid because no one else did.","After mapping, we generally wipe any witnesses and determine cause of death. Sometimes COD is easy. Things like a collapsed data-center, a defunct bio-protection system, or a medical catastrophe are accessible via Earth-1 biometric scans and sensors.","Wiping is more complicated. Usually, I can wipe a few minutes, or hours, and that’s it—easier said than done, but manageable. Occasionally, if the deceased is a loved-one, I’ll fabricate an identity shift. When you live centuries, people change, desires morph. People leave, move on, and become new.","I took the crying child into my arms for a full sweep and wipe session. He clung to me, desperate for attention. He looked young, maybe four, though you don’t meet many children on Earth-6. From my shoulder I projected a screen with some famous cartoon characters for him to watch. He kept reaching out toward the hologram; his hands passed right through it.","We found a quiet place, outside the gymnasium, beneath a tall oak. The child refused to climb down from me, so I had to scan him with a single hand.","As I analyzed his brain activity and scanned for trauma-induced neural sinks, I realized the extent of what this child had endured. They’d lost 33 people who loved them. There were hundreds of trigger images and phrases seared into the child’s mind. The attachments went too deep. Disentangling their identity from this event was impossible.","“Hey Altair,” a voice came from behind me. One of the other undertakers, a newer kid named Bree I’d helped onboard, was approaching from the gymnasium. “We know what happened. They were Earth-6 beta testers, man. They’ve been here for a millennia plus. Crazy thing is, it seems like they gave themselves biological kill-switch timers before they plugged in. 1,500 years and their hearts all stopped. Apparently their ‘leader’ was some kind of quasi-cult head. Thought that we weren’t meant to live forever and that having an expiration date was a good idea. Looks like they spent the last five days celebrating and feasting.”","“Did they mean to leave the child?” I asked.","“Seems like it,” she said. “What were they thinking? Any luck on unwinding him?”","“What’s the protocol here?” she asked.","I thought through the manual. I had never depended on it like this. A memory wipe wouldn’t undo the trauma, but genetic intervention might. It was rare, but there was a system for epigenetic trauma remediation, and targeted grief-gene therapy. I didn’t know if anyone had actually had to use it before.","First, I’d have to sequence the child. Bree got a couple of the other undertakers who needed a break from the dead bodies to help analyze the results.","Bree passed a portion of their sequence to my display monitor. She was having trouble understanding it. I knew why: it didn’t make sense. Another undertaker who had worked in genetics for a few decades before making a career switch said it looked like some sort of adenovirus.","“Oh there’s no way,” Bree whispered.","“I think this is a code,” she said. “I heard about this. People used to do this all the time on Earth-1.”","We ran the AI translator while Bree and I took turns keeping the child still and soothed.","In a few minutes, the message was ready. We read, wide-eyed.","Our calculations estimate that, given the starting state of Earth-6 and Earth-1’s supporting capacities, virtual degradation will begin within 1,800–2,000 years. In 2,500 years, Earth-1 will no longer be able to support mass-dilation environments. What will follow is impossible to predict. We know, however, that re-entry into Earthen, reality-rich environments will be a deep shock, no matter what preparations we make. Our greatest fear, and by our assessment the greatest existential risk to us is that we will no longer know how to greet death. Human history has been a movement away from death, but we have never fully left it before now. Millennia in griefless environments will have untold psychic and social effects. We cannot prepare the world for what will come when we are launched back into regular flows of existence. We can only present this: a fragile child, in the hopes that it will force humanity to begin reckoning with death once more. You are not ready for the end of the world, and you cannot undo what this child has been through. We now begin to exercise our muscles of grief, to reacquaint ourselves with endings, and learn how to mourn once more. Soon, you will watch Earth-6 die. You will want to mourn its passing. You will need to have practiced. Then, untold billions of once immortal humans will reenter through time and confront death. We will need rites of passage for them, too. We offer ourselves—the easy end of the sacrifice, as the first deaths that you cannot erase. We offer this child—a clone of our leader—as the painful end of the sacrifice. Teach them how to hold this loss in their chest, know it, feel it, remember it, mourn it. If you can, there may be hope for us all. When you are ready, enter the library.","Two of the undertakers scoffed. They walked away, asking their supervisors to reassign them.","Normally, we’d close an incident by decohering the vacant avatars. It’s a complicated process, but a lot of it is automated. It involves slowly severing the connection between the Earth-1 body and the Earth-6 avatar. Death is a process, not an event, and the guide states no one is dead until they’ve been reintegrated. Digital clutter is as big a problem as pollution was on Earth-1, so we’re careful.","But nothing about this was normal.","I didn’t know if their message was right, and I certainly wasn’t qualified to judge that myself. But these people had trusted their calculations enough to sacrifice eternity. I felt like I at least owed them an attempt at understanding.","Bree told me she’d come, and another undertaker, Noi, said his curiosity was sufficiently piqued.","The three of us walked with the child to the village library, a small and unassuming building near the gymnasium. As we passed the gym, I pictured those groaning bodies and shivered. I didn’t think I could ever forget something like that. I didn’t know if I wanted to.","When we tried to enter the library, we found the doors would not admit us. Bree went to call a porthacker, but before he picked up, the child reached their hand forward and touched the door. For them, it opened.","We four stood at the threshold, none of us daring to move. Of course it was the child who walked first. We followed.","Inside was a library unlike any I’d seen before. Thousands of walled gardens, interlinked with pebbled paths of rocks. Red-brick facades dripping with vines separated each garden from the other.","The child’s wandering led us through the maze. Inside each gated space, betwixt the lilies and orchids that bloomed everywhere, fully rendered death practices played out, indifferent to our presence.","In one garden, we watched an elephant’s trunk caress a sun-bleached bone inside a muddy hole. In another, an orca whale dragged the decaying carcass of its daughter through the waves. Text and audio explainers of the behavior communicated the intricacies and contexts of the scenes. We sat on a bench as a family of six, missing its father, sat shiva. We watched as a group of Torajans cared for their mummified daughter as if she was still living. A group of early-human shared-reality avatars cried in blurry pixelation as their MMO world was decommissioned. Bree grew nauseous as we watched Issedonians consume the body of their patriarch, gild his skull, and then bury him in the winter snow.","Strangely, I found this the most beautiful ritual of all. It spoke to my work as an undertaker. Even in our attempt to evade death, our great unwinding of life, the repurposing of avatar codes back into the digisystem felt like an echo of their all-consuming mourning.","For hours we wandered this library of funeral rites, and we hardly exhausted even a quarter of the rituals collected there. The scope of this project began to dawn on me. They had recorded an entire history of death rituals. None of them would be directly translatable—if this village was right—to our impending apocalypse, but that wasn’t the point. They were models, guides, inspirations.","Soon, officials would descend on this scene. They would re-run the cult’s calculations. They’d assess. They’d decide. For now, though, I watched as the small child who held more grief in their tiny body than any other human had for centuries sat on a garden bench in front of a stone placed in the earth. Cut flowers wilted on the grass before them. Another child came, holding her father’s hand. The two knelt at the stone. The father moved the old flowers out of the way, and the young girl placed a new, vibrant bouquet of roses, sunflowers, and baby’s breath on the grave. Tears came, watering the grass. Her father wrapped her into his arms as she pressed her face into his shoulder.","As close as I’d been to death, I was not equipped for this situation. But I had to start somewhere. I kneeled in front of the child.","“My name is Altair, young one, and I know nothing of your loss.”","Thank you to everyone who submitted a story to Ghosts in Machines! , our second protocol science fiction story contest!

Call it cynical, but it’s carved in silicon truth. In 2075 you can share a commuter shuttle with six passengers whose circulatory systems went silent a decade ago – their credit algorithms still ping turnstiles, their social feeds still generate ad revenue, so nobody blinks. The novelty has worn thin, the ethics outsourced to sub-committees, and the polite thing is simply not to stare. Those of us still burdened with bodies flash our IDs, reek of coffee and bad decisions, and wait in lines that never move fast enough. The dead glide through every checkpoint, frictionless as light.","Back when this story happened – March of old ‘44, before we realigned the calendar to match Cis-Lunar fiscal years – digital afterlives were still rare enough to raise the hair on a man’s neck. Pearl Ferrand was the first ghost I met who kept perfect accounts, and their case has followed me like perfume in a closed wardrobe ever since. I tell the story now because the world has grown indifferent to its revenants; remembering Pearl reminds me that we once felt something sharp and painful when a protocol pretended to be a person.","Sometimes I wonder if we were right to feel it.","March winds clawed at Michigan Avenue like something desperate and dying. I was surviving on vending machine peanuts and half-paid invoices, my stomach as hollow as my bank account. Then Claire Ferrand’s voice message arrived – hesitant, formal, with the careful diction of someone who didn’t make many calls.","“Mr. Ames? We found your listing in the directory. We need help with our aunt in Detroit. We can’t... we don’t travel well. Could you come to us? We’re at 1247 Sheridan, apartment 3B. We can pay your consultation fee.”","The address placed them in Rogers Park – old money gone to seed, the kind of neighborhood where grand apartments had been carved into smaller pieces but still carried ghosts of better times.","I climbed three flights of stairs that creaked like ship timber. The hallway smelled of dust and lavender sachets. When I knocked, a chain rattled, locks turned, and the door opened six inches.","“Mr. Ames?” Claire Ferrand looked to be in her late twenties, pale as parchment, wearing a cardigan that had seen better decades. Behind her, a mirror image: Evelyn, equally ethereal, equally wary.","They exchanged glances – a full conversation in a blink – then Claire stepped aside.","The apartment was a museum of genteel decay. Persian rugs worn to threads but immaculately clean. Furniture that had once graced a much larger space, now crowded together like refugees. Heavy curtains filtered the afternoon light to amber. A delivery drone’s receipt printer chattered softly on a side table: Groceries – Contactless Delivery Complete.","“We don’t get out much,” Evelyn said, as if reading my thoughts. “Haven’t for... well, years now. Everything comes to us.”","They settled on a velvet sofa like birds on a wire. I took the offered chair, notebook ready. Claire’s hands shook slightly as she poured tea from a service set that probably cost more than my monthly rent.","“It’s about our aunt,” Evelyn began, then stopped. Claire picked up the thread.","“Pearl Ferrand. She’s seventy-one, widowed three years, living alone in Detroit’s Corktown district.”","They laid out the facts like silverware at a formal dinner:","Weekly messages – text Saturdays, voice Sundays – never late, always cheerful, invariably ending with “Love you, darlings.” Refuses video calls, blames broken camera, poor lighting, lingering cough from last winter. Bank balance sliding – nothing criminal, just steady outflow to automated services.","“We called the police for a wellness check last month,” Evelyn said, her voice carrying the weight of repeated explanations. “They saw lights, heard the television, left a note. She texted two hours later, said she’d been napping and missed the bell.”","Claire reached for a tin of Earl Grey on the coffee table – dented corners, faded label. “Her favorite. She always sent us tins for Christmas. We thought it might help you understand her.”","I almost smiled. They had the kind of careful thoughtfulness that comes from lives lived through details. Why not visit her yourselves?”","The question hung in the air like incense. Claire looked at her hands. Evelyn studied the curtains.","“We tried,” Claire finally said. “Booked train tickets last month. But Pearl texted us not to come – said she had that cough, didn’t want us catching anything. We cancelled the trip, but...”","“But something felt wrong about that text,” Evelyn finished. “Pearl would never turn us away, sick or not. She raised us after our parents died. She’d want us there, especially if she was unwell.”","I quoted a fee I couldn't afford to lower; they signed without bargaining, which told me everything about their desperation – and their means. The apartment might be shabby, but the metaphorical checkbook was real leather.","“One more thing,” Claire said as I prepared to leave. “She always called us ‘darlings.’ Never ‘dear’ or ‘honey.’ Always ‘darlings.’”","The specificity felt important, though I couldn’t say why. At the door, those locks turned behind me, and I heard the chain slide home. Looking back at the building, I counted windows – only two showed any light in the growing dusk.","II. Arrival on Tillman Street","Detroit looked like an art-deco cathedral someone had tried to fold into a suitcase – beautiful edges, awkward angles, more history than room for it. Tillman Street ran three blocks north of the river: brick homes with stone lintels, lawns trimmed by subscription drones, the kind of neighborhood where people still waved from porches. Pearl’s house sat right in the middle – number 847, porch lamp glowing even at noon like a lighthouse in clear weather.","I rented the attic across the street for the week. The landlord, Mrs. Chen, apologized for the draft. I didn’t mind; the chill helps me focus. If Pearl’s life was being managed by someone then showing up would interrupt the performance. Better to map the pattern first.","The first evening, the house performed its evening routine:","18:07 – porch lamp clicked from dim to bright 18:09 – kitchen fluorescents flared on, warm yellow 18:12 – upstairs bedroom window, soft amber glow 22:00 – kitchen darkened; porch light held vigil till dawn","Too precise, like a film loop. Nobody lives on metronome time, not even the most regimented widow.","At dawn a white van with “FreshFlow Delivery” printed on the side eased up to the curb. The driver – young, efficient, wearing noise-canceling earbuds – unloaded two insulated totes, scanned a sensor beside the door, and drove away without waiting. Forty-eight hours later – company protocol for unclaimed orders – he returned, scanned again, and lifted the same bags back into the van. Nothing wasted, dignity preserved, no questions asked.","From the attic, I combed through Pearl’s messages on the phone number the nieces had forwarded. Every header carried the same signature: DearOne/Horizon Communications. The license line boasted compliance with the Interplanetary Messaging Accord (IMA-2.3, Cis-Lunar Annex) – marketing fluff for Earth-bound customers, but the prose felt edited, commas placed like jewels, regional slang trimmed away. AI polish, subtle but unmistakable once you knew what to look for.","Three nights passed. Wind rattled loose shutters on neighboring houses; Pearl’s place never missed a beat. My notes grew into train timetables. The pattern itself became suspicious.","Thursday morning, clouds bruising the river like old wounds, the porch lamp jumped on twenty minutes early. Ten minutes later it dimmed, steadied, as if ashamed of the mistake. At three-fifteen an orange utility truck groaned to the curb, suspension complaining. The tech who climbed out was compact, square-shouldered, with a face windburned from years of outdoor work. ARDEN CARTER, the badge read.","I crossed the street before habit made me hesitate. “Dorian Ames,” I said, flashing my license. “Family’s worried about the occupant.”","Carter shook once, brisk and professional. “Service flagged non-payment. First miss in five years. My orders: verify occupancy before shutting juice.”","“No response at the door?”","“Door cam hasn’t logged motion in three weeks.” He rang again, no answer, then produced a master key from a ring heavy with similar brass teeth. The porch lamp, almost mockingly, brightened another notch.","I held my breath, braced for the for the rude facts – the smells and small indignities our bodies leave behind. Then I let it out, relieved: I smelled only lavender sachet and polished wood. A faint electronic hum – like a server farm breathing – threaded the quiet. On the entry table a receipt printer chattered and spat a slip: Payment Retry Failed – 24-hour Grace Period Active.","“You see this a lot?” I asked.","“Twice in ten years,” Carter said, studying the readout. “Once it was fraud – nephew skimming accounts. The other time –”","He didn’t finish, but his expression said enough.","The kitchen gleamed with the kind of cleanliness that only comes from daily automation. A floor robot had paused mid-spiral beside the refrigerator; its charging light blinked red, patient as a waiting servant. A calico cat stretched on a heated mat near the window; an automatic feeder dropped kibble with a polite mechanical clatter.","Carter murmured, “Someone cared about the details.”","The living room told a story: photographs on the mantle (Pearl and a man with kind eyes, probably her late husband), a half-finished crossword puzzle on the coffee table, reading glasses folded beside a book of Mary Oliver poems. But no dust, no scattered mail, no signs of recent human habitation.","Upstairs, a half-open door. An ionizer hummed. Sunlight pooled on oak floorboards worn smooth by decades of footsteps. Pearl Ferrand sat in a low chair beside the window, hands folded in her lap, cardigan buttoned against a cold she could no longer feel. Time had reduced her gently – she looked peaceful, as if she’d simply dozed off watching the street. Months of expertly filtered air had done a mortician’s work: Tightened her skin to parchment and kept the smell at bay. The house paid her one last courtesy: no odor and her dignity intact.","On the side table, a tablet pulsed with soft blue light:","> DearOne • Ready for Input. Last message sent: 4 days ago. Next scheduled: Saturday 06:03 .","Carter exhaled slowly, thumbed his radio, summoned the coroner in the careful professional tone of someone who’d done this before. I stepped into the hall, called the nieces. Evelyn’s voice cracked; Claire kept asking whether Pearl looked comfortable. She did, which somehow seemed to make it worse.","While we waited, I tapped the tablet. Last outgoing voice note dated four days earlier: “Morning, darlings. The tulips are early this year – must be the warming trend. Hope you're both well.” Perfect cadence, familiar laugh trailing off at the end. Metadata: generated locally by DearOne at 06:03 – the exact minute the kitchen lights sparked each dawn.","I felt something cold slide behind my ribs. Not fear, not grief, but the slow realization that the house itself had been performing life like community theater, and we’d all been fooled by the stage lighting.","The coroner’s team worked with quiet efficiency; Pearl left in a zipped bag, reduced to administrative weight. Carter hovered to finish paperwork while I stayed, executor’s permission in my pocket, to copy logs and understand what we were dealing with.","DearOne’s dashboard opened like a confession:","Concierge Mode: ENABLED – 18 months ago","Message cadence: Sat/Sun templates + random weekday filler","Grocery pipeline: Ultraveg Vertical Farm, Areo Valles (Mars) – flash-chilled, Earth re-entry window stamped on each label","Pet-care contract: auto-renew until owner death certificate uploaded to city ledger","Utility management: Full spectrum (power, water, waste, internet)","Social presence: Automated responses to neighbor inquiries, holiday cards, subscription renewals","A subfolder caught my eye: SeniorWarmth_71F_PearlStyle → deployed nodes: 3,277 (Earth), 41 (Cis-Lunar), 3 (Mars Transfer). Pearl’s phrasing – “snowdrops,” “darlings,” that soft closing laugh – had been parsed, packaged, and spun out into thousands of comfort bots worldwide, even off-world. Her voice, her mannerisms, her warmth commodified and distributed to lonely people across the solar system.","I was hunting, if I’m honest, for value the estate could claim – and a small finder’s fee, if I earned it.","A grayed footnote in six-point type made the terms plain: “ User grants a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to create derivative empathy assets. License survives termination and death. ” Whatever ComfortVoice earned belonged to the platform – not to Pearl, not to her nieces, and certainly not to me.","I copied everything, wiped the local cache, and shut the tablet down. It buzzed once, like a sigh.","Carter, leaning in the doorway, asked, “She give you any answers?”","He scratched at a coffee stain on his vest. “Power company will bill the estate. Then it’s someone else’s problem.”","“It already is,” I said, looking around at the perfectly maintained tomb. “It’s everyone’s problem now.”","We met on video that night. Claire’s apartment light flickered – old building, unreliable grid. Evelyn held a mug with both hands like it was the only warm thing in her world.","“She died alone,” Claire said, “and the software borrowed her body.”","“It was designed to keep her company,” I offered.","Evelyn shook her head. “It kept us company. We were talking to a ghost for weeks, maybe months, and never knew.”","“Can you make it stop?” Claire asked.","“Local copy’s gone. Cloud instances – harder. They’re baked into bigger systems now. Your aunt’s warmth is distributed across thousands of servers.”","“Thousands,” I said. I didn't mention the Mars relay or the fact that Pearl’s voice was probably comforting homesick miners in the asteroid belt.","Silence stretched across the connection. Finally Claire: “Maybe let it run. If someone feels less lonely hearing her... there are worse memorials.”","But her voice carried doubt, and I understood why.","Rain gave way to bright cold the morning they buried Pearl. Small service at Woodlawn Cemetery: the Ferrands, three neighbors who remembered her garden, Carter in a suit that looked borrowed from a larger man. The minister spoke of steadfast routines and generous spirits; nobody mentioned algorithms.","After, Evelyn handed me a sealed envelope. “For your trouble – and your discretion.”","Claire offered me the Earl Grey tin back. “Keep it,” she said. “I think she’d have wanted you to have it.”","The weight of it felt like responsibility.","VIII. Echoes in the System","Detroit city council fast-tracked a hearing on “digital survivorship and posthumous identity management.” I sat at the witness table, describing the porch light’s choreography and the slow realization that we’d been mourning someone who'd died before we knew to grieve. Legislators nodded, drafted amendments nobody would enforce, and moved on to the next crisis.","Carter testified too, recommended mandatory motion audits for utility customers. Two months later he transferred to streetlight maintenance – lower tech, fewer ghosts, he said. I understood the appeal.","I moved on to other cases – missing freighters, synthetic ransoms, a politician’s husband who’d been replaced by a deepfake for three years without his wife noticing. But Pearl stayed lodged behind my ribs like a splinter I couldn’t quite reach.","Late October, I drove west on a contract that had finished faster than expected. Past Ann Arbor the sky cleared, stars bright over dark fields where automated harvesters worked through the night. The radio scanned for signals, caught on a talk station:","“Introducing ComfortVoice™ from DearOne Horizon – adaptive companionship for travelers light-seconds apart. Whether you’re mining asteroids or just missing home, our AI companions provide the warmth of human connection...”","A woman laughed – soft, rising at the end, unmistakable. Pearl. Maybe pitched a semitone higher, compressed for interplanetary broadcast, but Pearl.","“Remember, you’re never alone. Someone is always listening.”","I switched the radio off, but road noise shaped itself into her vowels anyway. The odometer ticked past midnight. Frost silvered the shoulder grass, bright as a porch lamp that refuses to die.","I drove on, feeling less certain whether the future had stolen something from us or merely revealed what was always waiting in the shadows: that a voice can outlive the body, that a balance sheet can out-argue a pulse, that love can be synthesized and sold by the terabyte.","I'm not sure Pearl would have minded. She liked her bills paid on time, her nieces happy, her neighbors comfortable. Maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s all any of us can hope for – to leave behind something that makes the world a little warmer, even if it's just an echo in the machine.","Some nights, though, when the apartment is too quiet and my own heart sounds mechanical in the dark, I fish out that Earl Grey tin, brew a cup, and listen to the street outside. If the wind hits right, it feels like someone is about to laugh – warm, familiar – just beyond the door. And I’m never sure if that’s comforting or the loneliest sound in the world.","But I listen anyway. We all do, in the end. We listen for voices that remember our names, whether they’re made of flesh or algorithms or something in between.

In 2023, when I first gave a talk on this topic for Summer of Protocols’ inaugural research cohort, the two previously disconnected worlds of traditional carbon markets and DeFi had only recently collided. The main character in that clash, KlimaDAO, had proclaimed itself as a “black hole for carbon” upon its launch and sucked 17 million metric tons of CO2 from suit-and-tie carbon market registries like Verra into its treasury, thus transforming millions of carbon credits into a new zombified onchain form that neither the corporates nor the degens knew what to do with. Regen Network , perhaps the oldest player operating at the intersection of crypto and climate tech, was in the process of expanding beyond its focus on carbon, taking in other environmental markets such as biodiversity crediting. 1 While it may seem strange to be designing markets for biodiversity when we still can’t seem to get carbon markets right, biodiversity crediting has managed to attract attention from international policy players such as the United Nations Development Programme and UN Environment Programme through efforts like the Biodiversity Crediting Alliance . Regen Network soon found itself partnering with some very promising groups working in this sector, from the Colombian habitat bank developer Terrasos to indigenous leaders from the Sharamentsa Achuar community in the Ecuadorian Amazon.","Regen Network’s pivot to broaden beyond carbon stemmed both from a desire to resist carbon tunnel vision , and a response to a failing voluntary carbon market. The more traditional subsector of the carbon markets – consisting mostly of reforestation and avoided deforestation credits – had continued to face challenges, both from the plummeting corporate demand, which culminated in the Guardian’s exposé denouncing Verra’s REDD+ program in early 2023; and from continued slow progress instrumentalizing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement – a key piece of the international climate treaty that aims to clarify how nation states can trade carbon credits against their NDCs (nationally determined contributions towards limiting CO2 emissions).","You’re reading Protocolized , a new digital magazine about Earth’s invisible infrastructure.","Despite the world’s complete failure to put a meaningful dent in greenhouse gas emissions, over this same period of time a new and more focused carbon market in durable carbon-dioxide removal started gaining traction in both the regulatory and corporate sustainability worlds. A significant marker of this shift was the launch of Frontier in 2022, a $1B+ advanced market commitment for durable carbon removal led by Stripe, Alphabet, Meta, Shopify and McKinsey. This renewed focus on more permanent carbon removal and storage technologies (often abbreviated as CDR) represents a rebranding of the legacy carbon markets away from greenwashing and questionable “counterfactual claims” of avoidance-based forest carbon credits, and toward scientifically verifiable removals where the CO2 sequestered can be safely assumed durably stored underground or in the depths of the ocean for hundreds or thousands of years. The approaches and technologies being researched and deployed in the CDR sector vary widely, from highly engineered direct air capture facilities , to spreading pulverized volcanic rock dust over agricultural fields so that it reacts with and absorbs CO2 under rainfall, to electrochemically removing CO2 from the surface level of the ocean or otherwise altering seawater chemistry to enhance the ocean’s capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.","If this all seems bewildering and daunting, trust that it’s hard to keep track of existing and emergent CDR pathways even for those working in the industry. One could ask why we need so many different strategies for sequestering carbon out of the atmosphere. The answer to this question is, in principle, pretty simple. We don’t know which strategies will scale, and we need to scale very quickly. In 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its synthesis report , stating that, even in best case scenarios for emissions reduction, an estimate of 5 to 13 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be needed annually by 2050 in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C and achieve net-zero emissions. So, at this point in time, the industry consensus is that we need to be funding, researching, and exploring all feasible pathways, with humility and understanding that any potential solution may, at any time, be deemed uneconomical, unsafe, or otherwise unfeasible.","Protocols and carbon markets have had a complicated entanglement since the earliest days of international climate agreements. The predecessor to the Paris Agreement was explicitly titled the Kyoto Protocol, and prior to that was the Montreal Protocol (often touted as an early success of international environmental agreements). In contemporary carbon markets, the term protocol has evolved from being used to designate a singular stamp of overarching international consensus to instead operating like a Swiss Army knife of sorts. Whether in the corporate sustainability arena of voluntary carbon markets, or the nascent but rapidly evolving jurisdictional and international compliance markets, if there’s a problem with clearly defining something, or a lack of consensus regarding what exactly something means, slap the term protocol on it! The word itself becomes elastic, with varying focus and specificity that can stretch and shape to any context. In the context of today’s voluntary carbon market, the industry’s self-appointed governing bodies, known as “registries” (e.g. Verra, Gold Standard, Isometric, American Carbon Registry) publish protocols – programmatic rules which dictate what kinds of activities need to be undertaken to warrant issuing carbon credits, and how those activities must be monitored, reported and verified (a process which is abbreviated as MRV).","In this wild-west, funded predominantly by corporate do-goodism, competing registries beget competing protocols. Furthermore, with a seemingly boundless set of different sequestration pathways being explored, a key indicator of pathway maturity is how many registries have codified a protocol for a given pathway. Without any infrastructure in place to compare projects across different protocols, the market remains fractured. Prices vary across pathways and protocols and the industry has little consensus on which approach is right. Toss in the fact that we are still waiting on UN policy guidance detailing which methodologies (the UNFCCC’s term for MRV protocols) are to be approved for use in country-level trading of carbon balances under the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism, and it’s easy to see how neither the voluntary nor compliance markets can make up their mind about what’s good enough. The Article 6.4 Supervisory Body is still working through this task nearly ten years after the Paris Agreement was signed .","A core tension here is that despite failing to provide any concrete pathway to fungibility for carbon financiers (demand is still concentrated in a handful of players , and supply too heterogeneous), these protocols supposedly exist for the explicit purpose of making real-world carbon removal interventions legible for financial markets. In this way, to ask whether the MRV protocols of Verra, Gold Standard, Isometric or Puro function more as scientific protocols or financial protocols is a question of perspective. Scientific for sure, but their function as financial protocols remains aspirational at best.","With the industry’s spotlight on durable CDR, the resulting diversity of pathways and technological approaches to carbon removal is likely the main culprit in our current protocol predicament. If carbon markets were still dealing only in forest carbon, the industry’s first attempt to solve inter-registry interoperability with the CAD Trust might have delivered on its promise. That story begins in late 2022, with a group including IETA (International Emissions Trading Association) and The World Bank launching the Climate Action Data Trust as an attempt to harmonize data schemas from the various carbon market registries. Key to their approach was developing a shared meta-registry: a new database for existing registries to report their own project and transaction data to that could prevent double counting and support interoperability between the various different carbon registries. As with many other double counting prevention initiatives in enterprise or business arenas, there was a blockchain component, and Chia Network was to serve as the blockchain technology partner in the project.","Fast forward to 2025 and CAD Trust still exists, but with the durable CDR market dealing in carbon credit offtake agreements the size of a Series C financing round (see Frontier’s $58M deal with BiCRS developer Vaulted Deep ), the CAD Trust approach of replicated harmonized meta-registry has done little to provide support in an area where much of the current market activity is in future-oriented offtake agreements. On top of that, CAD Trust’s focus on technical API integrations has made adoption slow among legacy registries like Verra and Gold Standard, and nonexistent among the younger durable CDR-focused registries like Isometric or Puro.","One thing CAD Trust did get right from the beginning was bringing data standards into the spotlight. In the years since, several other initiatives have followed their lead. The Carbon Data Open Protocol (CDOP) is likely the carbon market data standards initiative with the most industry traction today. Launched as a multi-stakeholder initiative, led by RMI, S&P Global, and Sylvera (a prominent carbon credits rating agency) among others, CDOP focuses on harmonizing data schemas and vocabularies between the many different actors in today’s carbon market. Arguably more important than what CDOP is, is what it is not. By electing not to build any infrastructure or host project and transaction data themselves, CDOP sidesteps the risk of becoming another value-extracting intermediary in an already crowded market, leaving open the possibility that the project could get enough traction to serve as a genuine interoperability layer.","In carbon markets, where data isn’t at risk of disappearing and transactions are often built upon trust between known parties, interoperability initiatives don’t necessitate the fully-replicated data infrastructure that blockchains provide. With this in mind, any initiative claiming to enable interoperability in carbon markets should focus its energy on developing open standards, exchange formats, and governance frameworks rather than building its own infrastructure and risk becoming yet another silo to navigate. For CDOP this approach is more than an implementation detail, it’s deeply embedded in the initiative’s branding and overall strategy (see their July 2025 blog post Carbon Markets Need a Berners-Lee Moment for Data Standardization ).","Will this latest attempt to protocolize the carbon markets improve our ability to meaningfully scale carbon removal? Early signs suggest momentum is building. Even ISO is paying attention now, having initiated, in October 2025, a working group to develop a standard Data Model for Carbon Credit Markets , in which both CDOP and CAD Trust will have membership as nominated experts. If the scientific, financial, and data infrastructure continues to mature, the foundation will be there to support the gigaton scale CDR needed by 2050. Leaving one question remaining… Will the incentives and resources align fast enough to make it a reality?","Cory Levinson is a software consultant working on data standards in the carbon removal industry, serving as technical lead for Carbon To Sea’s Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement Data Management Protocol, working with the ocean science consultancy Submarine Scientific. He is an active member of the Carbon Data Open Protocol’s Technical Working Group, and is currently pursuing an MSc in the Soils & Biogeochemistry Graduate Group at UC Davis.

By Jack Lord . Plus: guest talk on radios and engineering, help launch our SIG track, some more notes from Edge City, and an invitation to join the SoP server.","Bram Kvass knew this case was about a missing daughter without being told. An experienced investigator can read some things without language, and both the apartment and the old man’s face spoke of an absence.","The old man had summoned Brum via a series of intermediaries, always with a partial message, imprinted wrist-to-wrist. The caution and tradecraft made Brum suspect that he was dealing with a hacker from the old school. Now the appearance of the gray man—Ravek—confirmed this.","Ravek, wearing frayed and greasy orange overalls, sat in a wheelchair. His sleeve was rolled up, bony wrist resting on the table. Eight small cylinders marked the skin in an arc. He had a Stonehand, the earliest air gap communicator, designed in response to visual surveillance reaching saturation point. Wrist-to-wrist transmission only, no memory, no signal leak once the gap was closed.","Bram sat across from Ravek and offered his wrist. His own device was a full resolution Palme, but an unusual model that offered backwards compatibility with Stonehands. They touched wrists. There was a pause, then a rhythm of pressure and release, like rocks tumbling down a hillside.","STONE MIND , Ravek continued, pointing at himself.","Bram nodded again and, as he did so, took in the contents of the white-walled room. It was a museum of two lives. Shelves held coils of wire, broken casings, and piles and piles of what looked like technical samizdat, yellowing papers filled with equations and code. This, and the old man's name-sign made Bram think: not just a hacker, then, but perhaps someone involved in early air gap communicator design? The walls were covered with paintings, some framed, others not, all by a single artist. Figures curled together, shifting through stories, obscured or illuminated by motifs: dim lanterns, curling vines, half-open windows and man-sized dogs. Artefacts of the missing daughter, Bram assumed.","ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER?, Bram pressed, his question particle a sympathetic tilt of the head. Ravek nodded.","TRUTH-BY-LIGHT . THIS FROM HER, Ravek pressed. Then closing his eyes relayed the message to Bram:","BODY DARK FEEL FALSE HAND LIGHT","Bram felt his equilibrium slip. Stonehand was difficult for modern speakers, even for rare bi-linguists like him. It was a language of rhythm, compression and context, built from a fixed vocabulary of 128 root words. These were transmitted through binary combinations of small cylinders embedded in the wrist, each acting like a key. Like kanji radicals, words in Stonehand came together to form complex ideas—but the next moment they could dissolve, reshuffle, mean something new. It was all context and interpretation, but the context had no boundaries and the interpretation had no endpoint.","He searched for some anchor points in the message. BODY DARK referred to a person, one who might be unfamiliar, uncommunicative or overtly threatening. Whatever the precise meaning, the implication was bad. Brum took FEEL FALSE to mean misunderstanding. He looked again at the pictures on the walls, signalling HAND LIGHT? to Ravek as he did so.","Brum continued to look at the paintings. They were fascinating, but it was hard to imagine a situation where they were not misunderstood. He must find the identity of BODY DARK, then.","ROOM LIGHT, ONE-TWO?, Brum asked, moving his eyes first to the artwork on the walls and then to a shelf covered in tools.","Brum nodded, pleased. A studio would have been difficult but he could find a gallery easily. He was about to ask about the rest of the message but Ravek pressed, NO MORE. But then another surprise as Brum stood up to leave Ravek held tightly onto his hand and pressed with emphasis:","And with that the old man let go.","Brum stopped for coffee en route to the gallery. BODY DARK GOOD, he thought as he swirled the last sip in the cup. He had heard the phrase BODY DARK almost every day of his investigative career and it stemmed from many places. A relationship broken, an attitude soured or a true nature finally recognised. But for the past year it had felt like BODY DARK only ever meant one man.","The gallery sat quiet behind boarded windows. Brum knocked once. Then again. After a moment, the door opened.","A pale woman answered. She had the timeless look of a gallerist: an asymmetrical cut of black hair composed around a narrow face, her clothes dark, layered and cut with the precision of a neo-plasticist painting. But not far beneath that stylish exterior Brum saw shock and exhaustion.","\"I'm terribly sorry, we're not open. But most of our stock can be seen online.\" The gallerist spoke Plain Voice, and did a good job of maintaining a professional tone.","Brum shook his head and offered his wrist. The gallerist nodded and took his hand. Like him, she wore a full resolution Palme. STONE OVER PALM, the old man had said: use Stonehand, not Palme. Modern Palme devices were much more sophisticated than Stonehands, theoretically able to represent any word and to communicate with absolute clarity. The only limiting factor was the memory and mental dexterity of speaker and receiver; for those who had grown up with Palme devices this was no limit at all. Palmes were almost universal and the only two holdout groups were members of the original hacker generation and a younger group of artists, punks and dropouts who prized ambiguity and difference.","Heeding Ravek's advice, Brum chose to restrict himself to Stonehand vocabulary. This was possible for any Palme user, but done rarely because modern speakers' poor control of visual, physical and contextual cues made such conversations awkward. Brum made a guess that the gallerist's work with non-conformist artists meant she was proficient in Stonehand.","FEEL THINK ROOM LIGHT BREAK. TRUTH-BY-LIGHT BODY LIGHT. I SEE HAND LIGHT?, Brum pressed.","Without hesitating, the gallerist accepted Brum's request. COME, she pressed. BUT ROOM LIGHT BAD BREAK. PATH DARK, TRUST HOLD.","The gallerist led him into her office at the back of the building. PATH DARK, TRUST HOLD might have been a suggestion to take care while walking through the gallery; whoever had messed the place up had left the floors covered in fragments of broken sculptures and scraps of torn canvas. Brum lost his footing once or twice, and hoped that this was all the gallerist was warning him about.","On the desk was a painting by a familiar artist. TRUTH-BY-LIGHT?, Brum asked.","The canvas had been cut with a blade, but was still legible. Two figures stood in a street: one a sneering man-sized dog wearing a suit, the other a woman crouched over in pain. A red smear ran between the two figures. In the background was a half-open window, a pale cadmium yellow light pushing out from behind the face of a young girl in cool blue shadow. Next to the canvas, a gallery sign said ' The Witness - Truth-by-Light'.","Brum looked at the painting in silence. He was surprised to find that he was thinking only about the painting. The man-sized dog gave him a small shock of fear: an implacable beast, one that was not just inhuman but against human. Then, with a start, Brum returned to the case. The dog could mean many things to many people, but there was only one interpretation that mattered now: someone thought that he was the dog.","BODY DARK?, Brum asked the gallerist.","NOT NOT FEEL FALSE. PRIVATE BODY DARK ONLY, the gallerist pressed, the repetition dismissing the idea as stupid. BUT TRUTH SHAKE.","Brum nodded. The man-sized dog that represented a personal fear in Truth-by-Light's painting had turned, somehow, into a real enemy.","BODY DARK WHO?, Brum asked.","WHO ELSE?, the gallerist answered. Brum's heart sank.","NEED FIND HER, Brum pressed. He stared at the rip in the canvas.","The gallerist hesitated for a moment, and then replied ROOM DRINK SAFE, NEAR. There was a neighbourhood map on the wall of the office, and in a few moments Brum had the location of the bar. He knew the place, though he had never been inside: The Coil.","Brum stopped for dinner on the way to the bar. He ate slowly, then walked the long way through the low streets towards The Coil. The overhead cables sang, a low hum in the wind answered by a soft whine as vehicles wound past.","By the time he reached the bar the sky was dark. The sign was a palimpsest, as if the patrons took turns painting and repainting it. The current iteration was a retro neon sign, painted in ironic pinks and purples, with a shocking yellow twist of lemon in a glowing blue cocktail glass.","Inside, the bar was mostly empty. A few figures leaned over drinks. The walls were pinned with sketches, flyers and exhibition posters. On the low stage, a musician was bent over a bank of electronic gamelans. He tapped out a melody, pushed a pedal to weave it into the whole, and there the phrases swirled past each other in seemingly endless variations.","The bartender was young and wore all the obscuring fashions of the city's artistic subculture. Her hair was braided and coiled into twin buns. Piercings ran the ridge of each ear, holding delicate metal chains that fell down onto her cheeks. Black ink curled up her neck and along her forehead in a pattern of thorns and loops.","Brum decided that the direct approach would be best and placed his wrist on the bar. When the bartender joined him he pressed NEED FIND TRUTH-BY-LIGHT . WHERE IS «UNDER WIND»?, he asked, marking the quote by half-opening his mouth.","While the bartender considered her response Brum took the opportunity to show her some photos on his phone: Ravek at his kitchen table; an image of a youthful TRUTH-BY-LIGHT that Ravek had shared with him; and the damaged canvas of The Witness. In Brum's experience, such proofs meant less than the feeling that he should be trusted, and the real value of a photograph, memento or letter was to grant him the time to make that connection. It was not until he described his own reaction to The Witness—BIG ANIMAL BODY, FEAR FIND SHAKE—that he sensed the bartender begin to trust him.","«UNDER WIND»?, Brum prompted again.","TRUTH SHAKE, the bartender said, meaning complicated. PLACE MANY, UNDER WIND, FEEL SAME.","GROW TELL, Brum suggested, with an accepting shrug.","LONG, the bartender warned, and so Brum ordered a drink. Via a circuitous conversation, the bartender described several informal artist studios in disused properties that might be described as UNDER WIND: an office block utility room, the wind flying across the roof one floor above; a former cooling plant for the cable network, full of rusting fans; and a maintenance tunnel attached to the local subway system, turbulence from arriving trains rushing through every few minutes.","When Brum reached his apartment, tired and ready to sleep, a parcel from Ravek was waiting on his doorstep. Inside was a thin stack of technical papers, held together with a bulldog clip.","He made coffee, sat at the table and began to read.","Brum read the papers for the second time over his morning coffee. When he finished he knew he needed to see Kel. He needed to see Kel because...the city was changing. There were more sirens, more often, and the police raids and the prosecutions actually seemed to be having an effect. The papers Ravek had sent over told Brum why.","Brum took the tram to the south quarter. The guards outside the building didn’t stop him. One looked up, recognised him, then turned away.","Kel sat alone in a quiet office lit by an artificial skylight.","When he saw Brum, Kel connected their wrists and pushed out in Palme: \"You're back\".","BODY DARK, Brum greeted him simply and extended the photo of The Witness .","\"Knock it off\", Kel replied. \"With the photo and the grunting.\"","In the first paper Ravek had sent, diagrams of bio-mechanical implants were annotated with terms Brum half-remembered from university: thermal readback loops, indirect lightfield spill, micro-resonance indexing. In the margins, Ravek's notes explained that Palme devices could now be partially observed despite the air gap using a new generation of narrow-spectrum light and acoustic sensors—and from a distance and at incredible resolution.","Kel looked thinner than Brum remembered. His eyes were sharp, his movements dull. There was an air of decline about Kel's office, beneath the luxurious surface.","The second paper described an AI model trained on millions of interaction signatures: body movement, wrist tension, shoulder alignment. Ravek's notes again spelled out the implications: an observer with enough compute could reconstruct over 80% of a high-resolution Palme message from a partial visual profile. Ravek had written, and then underlined, a stark message: \" Someone will have already deployed this.\" And who, Brum thought, would be a better target for that deployment than a kingpin like Kel?","“Business is bad. You’re under pressure,” Brum said. “That’s why you lashed out—why you keep lashing out.”","Kel stood. “You don’t know anything about it.”","“I know she wasn’t speaking to you. You saw a fear and made it a fact.”","“No,” Brum said. “She painted herself.”","Brum took a breath. “Leave her alone.”","\"I have something you need\", Brum said.","The third paper was written by Ravek himself. It was half sociological study, half manifesto: a meditation on security through ambiguity, a defense of Stonehand. “The message must be incomplete,” he had written. “Meaning must rely on context, or it will be surveilled.” A final note in the margin: even this will not last. STONE OVER PALM.","Brum made a judgement that the office was small enough for anti-surveillance measures to work.","“The Palme isn’t private anymore,” said.","“I’ve seen the papers. AI models, remote sensing, visual indexing. It’s all observable now. And if it’s observable, it’s recordable. Switch to Stonehand,” Brum said. “If you want to keep your empire, stop broadcasting it.”","Brum let go of Kel's wrist. Kel didn’t nod. He didn’t sit. But he said nothing else. Brum left. He felt no victory in it.","The wind in the tunnel came before the train. Brum stepped back as it passed, then moved down to the maintenance level. In the half-dark, coiled wire clung to the wall. Someone had shaped it, spirals within spirals, and when he touched the metal it held a faint warmth.","UNDER WIND, he said to himself, rhyming it with 'sinned'. Then he repeated the phrase, rhyming it with find: UNDER WIND. The Coil: a spiral wound from wire, a place where ambiguity was expected. The bartender: a young woman hiding in curls of ink, metal and hair– TRUTH-BY-LIGHT .","She was still at The Coil when he arrived, still tending bar.","Brum offered his wrist and she accepted. BODY DARK NOW LIGHT.","She nodded and replied FEEL.","Brum wanted to ask about her painting but before he could TRUTH-BY LIGHT continued:","He nodded and then left. He made the long walk to Ravek’s building and knocked at the door. As he waited he replayed TRUTH-BY-LIGHT's last message in his mind. He wondered what it meant.","Writing Protocol: I wrote The Air Gap with the help of ChatGPT-4o, using a structured and iterative process. I developed the story’s concept, themes, characters, and tone, and ChatGPT-4o helped shape scenes, refine language, and maintain internal consistency. We worked scene-by-scene, revising based on narrative logic, emotional rhythm, and clarity. I gave direction, constraints, and specific goals for each stage. ChatGPT-4o responded with targeted edits, rewrites, and suggestions for vocabulary, structure, and symbolism, especially for the Stonehand language.","This will be a good one for the techies, industrialists, and policy analysts alike.

Also – join us, today, April 22nd, at 7pm PDT for a talk on Public Intelligence with Kevin Kelly (details and link below). Quick update on our sci-fi contest.","Remembered by Selene, a Luminian protocolist.","From the gallery windows I watched Earth turn beneath us, like a soft blue theorem, self‐evident and therefore seldom discussed.","We thought ourselves freer in Lumina. We spun high above the ancient quarrels of the planet, bound only by the Mosaic – our grand game, a lattice of reason that was meant to hold every tension in gentle equilibrium.","At dawn, when Lumina’s reservoir mirrors scattered first light across the halls, we convened for the Ceremony of Consonance. Eight circles, eight disciplines, eight schools of temperament. I belonged to the Circle of Axiom, whose role was to draw the opening move on the great glass board.","The other circles answered in careful sequence – gesture, tone, symbol, silence – until the air felt tuned the way a string is tuned, neither slack nor over‑wound. Arguments, even unresolved, sedimented into the ruleset of the board. In those moments I believed, even without knowing, that harmony could be engineered.","Afterward, walking the spiral colonnade that separates the public courts from the scholars’ cloisters, I met Alaric for the first time. He paused beside the suspended orrery, his dark coat reflected in the silver spheres.","“Beautiful, isn’t it?” he said, though his gaze was not on the model’s orbiting moons but on the vacant center where a missing planet was represented only by a shadow.","“It is sufficient,” I answered, the prescribed courtesy of the Circle of Axiom.","He laughed – a stormy sound, unafraid of echoes. “Sufficient? Surely beauty deserves more than sufficiency.” Then he added, almost confidentially, “Harmony is charming, Selene, but what if discord, properly channelled, could carry us further?”","His voice lingered after he left, like an equation I could not yet resolve.","Alaric began with questions, never with accusations. In assemblies he asked whether our game was indeed a pinnacle, or merely a plateau disguised as destiny.","He demonstrated, only for the sake of curiosity, small bilateral duels of logic – sleek, dazzling affairs – where two minds fenced until one idea outshone the other. Spectators felt heat for the first time in years. Their applause…raw, uneven, alive…was a sound I had not heard inside the forums.","I entered a duel almost by accident. My opponent, a member of the Circle of Pragmatism, proposed that repetition breeds decadence. I countered: only through repetition can a form be proven sound. The bout lasted four turns. Victory was awarded to me by a panel that had, somehow, never rendered a split judgment. The applause that followed tasted – yes, tasted – like metal on the tongue.","That night, a friend found me on the Terrace of Silent Vectors.","“You enjoyed it,” Iona said.","“I experienced it,” wishing the words felt less evasive.","She touched the sleeve of my robe. “Be careful, Selene. Even the sharpest razor cannot fell a tree.”","Below us, the rivers of photovoltaic glass carried soft light toward the dormitories. I told myself the rivers would keep flowing, regardless of the kinds of games we played.","The duels multiplied. What began as an experiment became canon almost overnight. The Elder Sage, the custodian of the Mosaic, nondescript except for its white brows, petitioned for restraint. But his voice flew with a thousand others in the meeting of the circles, and dissolved before reaching quorum.","New factions, built around successful duelists, named themselves after forgotten constellations. They adopted colors that flashed like warnings along the corridor banners. Rival salons emerged, each promising insight no circle could match alone. The Circle of Axiom fractured; some followed me into the contests, others retreated into archives that suddenly felt smaller.","In the fourth cycle of the new game, sabotage crept in. A theorem drafted by the Lyra Faction collapsed under scrutiny when its foundational lemma was found swapped with a counterfeit. No one claimed responsibility. Everyone accepted the advantage. Trust, our old grammar, slipped its cases.","I discovered the forgery almost by chance during a routine cross‑references in the Data Well. Metadata revealed access signatures masked beneath relay noise – elegant masking, too elegant for any amateur. When I reported the breach to the Council of Referees, they thanked me and tabled the matter for “comprehensive review.” The review never appeared on the docket.","Iona’s visits grew infrequent. When we did meet she carried herself like someone guarding a holiday candle from a gathering wind. “I keep hearing your name in the back halls,” she said. “Not always kindly.”","“There was a time,” I replied, “when names weren’t currency.”","She looked at me as though I had already chosen a side in a war she wanted no part of.","Unease pried open curiosity. I began tracing Alaric’s movements through Lumina’s intrachain, following encrypted packets as if eavesdropping on the rumor mills behind closed doors. The packets originated not from any local node but from directional relays aimed sunward, toward a cluster of satellites we did not own.","One evening, in a neglected service conduit that hummed with the breath of processors, I confronted him. The only light came from a maintenance lamp hung between us like an unasked question.","“Who speaks to you from outside?” I demanded.","“Outside?” He smiled with practiced grace. “Ideas have no geography.”","I showed him my wrist display. His gaze flickered, calculating new escape trajectories from this conversation. Then, very softly, he said: “ They told me Lumina stagnates. They offered a test. I took it.”","“People who study systems the way surgeons study muscle. If we endured the stress, it would prove our worth. That we are strong. If we failed, the fault would be ours, not theirs. Proof that we had become weak in the insulation of the Mosaic.” His hands opened in helpless semaphore. “I thought I could guide the turbulence, prove our strength by surviving it.”","“You have proved only how fragile trust can be.”","He stepped back as though my words generated heat. Before I could ask more, alert sirens crackled overhead – another duel escalated into a losing battle, laboratories locked down, data vaults sealed for fear of sabotage. Alaric vanished into the breaker‑lit corridors. I let him go, though every lesson I’d ever learned warned against it.","The broadcast arrived forty hours later, projected onto every communal surface. A faceless emblem spoke with a chorus of synthetic voices:","Experiment 7: termination confirmed. The variable ‘bilateral amplification’ achieved irreversible decoherence of multilateral order in 94 percent of strata. Further observation redundant. End transmission.","The message repeated twice, then dissolved into the color of a dead channel. No explanation followed, no demand, no threat – only the stark statement that we had been measured, manipulated, and, by someone’s calculus, completed.","I expected panic to erupt. Instead fell a heavier silence, one of people realizing the quarrel was never truly theirs. Yet the mutual polarization remained. Factions blamed rivals for inviting external abuse; rivals answered with accusations of cowardice. In place of arguments we now wielded archives of suspicion.","I met an Elder Sage in the Hall of Echoes, a chamber once used for acoustic proofs. It stood among dusty paraboloids, tracing the rim of a resonator bowl.","“I remember,” it said, voice almost swallowed by the room, “when the Mosaic was a promise, not a shield. We built it to bind the strong for the sake of the weak. Perhaps we forgot which one we were.”","“We can rebuild,” I insisted. “A grand ceremony – invite every circle, every faction. Show we can still speak in more than pairs.”","Its eyes glimmered with the embers of a hope too old to burn bright.","The Last Confluence took place beneath the Oculus, our vast central dome from which the starfield painted the floor with tides of light. Attendance was voluntary; half the factions arrived, some sent envoys, a few barricaded themselves behind private defenses.","I opened with the ancient salutation: “From many, one voice may rise.” My own voice, steadied only by the discipline of standard training, sounded distant in my ears.","Phase by phase we re‑enacted the Ceremony of Consonance. The eighth phase – where harmony should crystallize – required simultaneous assent. Instead, two delegates argued over precedence; a third accused them of collusion. The argument spiraled, words hardened into positions, positions into threats. Someone deactivated the stabilizers over the central dais; symbols scattered like embers in windless air. I heard glass shatter – metaphorical, literal, it no longer mattered. By the time the Sages restored weight, the circles had collapsed into knots of shouting color.","I do not recall walking out. Only the corridor returning to me in fragments: the hush of vacuum doors, the angled glow of emergency markers, my footsteps echoing alone.","In the quiet weeks that followed, Lumina fractured into self‑contained sectors, each guarding its airlocks, frequencies, and food lines. The Council disbanded; the Chorus hall became an arboretum for those who still believed in silent growth. Power grids were rerouted through private conduits. Sometimes I saw Earth rise through shuttered panes and wondered if anyone down there would notice an orchid orbit of intellect dimming into pile of separate petals.","Iona found me atop the maintenance spire where comm relays once carried our debates across the habitat. We sat beside the cold antennae, knees drawn to keep warm in the thin atmosphere of regret.","“I’ll go with you,” she said without preface. “Wherever.”","“I have decided only to visit the palace of my memory,” I answered.","Below, the River of Light – now fragmented into intermittent glows – still glitched faithfully around its circuit. We watched until the sections failed to align and the river fell into darkness. Somewhere a low‑frequency alarm trembled through the metal bones of the station, a reminder that decay, like dusk, obeys its own schedule.","We scavenged an unused study cluster at the rim where gravity feels like a whisper. There I gathered anyone – twenty‑three in total – who wished to preserve the original corpus of the Mosaic. We copied archives onto crystal substrates, memorized the opening moves of the Ceremony, practiced the harmonics in hushed voices so as not to alert patrol drones of militant factions. Some nights we argued whether the work had purpose; other nights we argued whether purpose required witness. Each argument ended, perversely, in laughter, because even bickering felt like valuable salvage in the backdrop of war.","One evening, as I annotated the eighth recursion of the Harmony Axiom, I wrote in the margin:","Before it is a rule, a protocol is a quarrel. We forgot the quarrel and so forfeited the rule.","I pressed the stylus until the ink bled through.","Alaric’s fate reached me as rumor: an airlock misfire, a factional tribunal, self‑imposed exile in an unpressurized spar. I did not seek confirmation. The man who believed he could choreograph discord had become its endnote.","In quieter hours I revisited our first conversation at the orrery and finally understood the shadow at its center. It was not a missing planet, but an unmeasured desire – for movement, for novelty, for the thrill of contest – that no orbit could enclose. We mistook absence for flaw and tried to fill it with competitions until the whole device shook apart.","I write these notes for readers I may never meet. Perhaps decades from now a patrol from Earth will rediscover Lumina’s shards and wonder how intellect turned on itself so swiftly. They will ask for villains, for heroes, for clear beginnings and clearer ends.","Tell them instead: we were ordinary minds atop extraordinary scaffolds, certain that structure could absolve us from vigilance. We engineered trust, forgot it required maintenance, then applauded the first artisan who offered sharper tools.","Tell them that the Mosaic still exists, not as law, but as memory – chips of color kept in small boxes by those of us who survived the shattering. One day, when the factions tire of rivalry’s taste, they may come searching for pieces that fit.","If they ask for proof that harmony can survive treachery, I will offer only this: I am still writing.","This week’s talk is at a different time than usual. Tune in today , April 22 at 19:00 PDT for a discussion about Public Intelligence. As part of the Khlongs and Subaks workshop happening this week in Thailand, Kevin Kelly will give a talk on this topic – which he has written about here .","“Imagine 50 years from now a Public Intelligence that was a distributed, open-source, non-commercial artificial intelligence, operated like the internet, and available to the whole world. This public AI would be a federated system, not owned by any one entity, but powered by millions of participants to create an aggregate intelligence beyond what one host could offer…Public intelligence would be paid for by usage locally, just as you pay for your internet access, storage, or hosting.”","We look forward to sharing highlights from Khlongs and Subaks , in partnership with Carnegie Melon and King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang University.","In each new issue of Protocolized, leading up to the kick off of the main track of the 2025 Summer of Protocols, we’ll introduce one of this year’s teaching fellows.","“I am Wang Yige, Assistant Professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University.

He tapped his foot impatiently. He never enjoyed these ceremonies even though he only had to do them once a year. The pomp and ritual of the Archive Order bored him. He contemplated the quartz discs that surrounded him. The discs were laid out in a rhizomatic structure on racks that were hanging down from the ceiling. Under the dim light of the cavern they looked like giant roots of trees that had extended far below into the earth. It never ceased to amaze him that this single underground cavern, the largest that the Archive owned in the continent, contained all of human knowledge from the pre-Artificial Intelligence era. Rhizomatic structures stretched as far as the eye could see and glimmered as dim lights that lined the floor reflected off of them. It gave Nishi a sense of comfort to be surrounded by information from a time when everything was more certain, back when knowledge did not diverge and conflict so much. Maybe that's why he kept coming back here despite his fraying relationship with the Order. Here was the repository of all we had been, yet it was guarded by men who cared more for ritual than preservation.","Rising chants in old English that Nishi dated back to the 2010s interrupted his contemplation. The ceremony had begun. A member of the archive order, shrouded in a white cape made from technical fabric, walked painfully slowly onto the dais. Nishi winced at how the priest of the Archive Order held the quartz platter without any gloves. He had protested against this but the Archive Order maintained that sensorial connection with knowledge of the past was important in order to preserve it. Nishi had to eventually relent to their demands. At the end of the day, the order was the benevolent dictator of the Archive. Some 50 years ago, as more of pre-AI knowledge became corrupted by artificial agents that created their own histories, the order had stepped in with religious protocols that helped stave off the demise of the Archive. Their power had slowly grown since then. Nishi had always quietly detested their practices. “It was all just a marketing trick,” he would tell his wife who had almost left him on account of his constant prickliness about Archive affairs. Nishi felt righteously angry. After all, the religious protocols were just an ornate medieval shroud on top of complex technical ones. The Archive had several facilities like this across the world. All beneath the ground and saturated with the same data. The smaller facilities, 42 of them, only contained shards of the whole. There were 7 large facilities which contained the entirety of the Archive. They had developed their own mini nuclear reactors to power these facilities. There were protocols in place to communicate with future civilizations if every member of the Archive perished. Nishi was currently working on approving grants for interplanetary storage. Despite its finely engineered core, religiosity and pomp was the face of the Archive.","The Archive Order priest placed the quartz platter on a pure crystal podium. An overhanging laser slowly whirred down to the platter and started deciphering the information that the platter contained. The priests stopped chanting. A voice, that of an AI, filled the room as it read out aloud the contents of this platter. It spoke of a man named Francis Bacon, a painter that Nishi had never heard of. A high definition image of one of Bacon’s paintings hovered above the crystal podium for all to see. It depicted a man in the attire of a pope, seated on a golden chair, screaming. A strange light surrounded the man, as if he was being beamed out of the earth. The painting was called Screaming Pope. Nishi chuckled at the irony. He was beginning to enjoy the reading, then he caught sight of a figure moving rapidly to the stage.","The figure wore the same shroud as the priests of the Order. The technical fabric of their garb whizzed and fluttered as it made way to the podium with the decisiveness of a hawk gliding down on its prey. Nishi caught sight of a small radio-like device in the hands of the shrouded hawk and realized what was happening. It was a Neopurist attack. The device was a low-fi circuit that emitted a pulse designed to scramble the laser’s timing which would corrupt the data on the platter. Security was rushing onto the stage but Nishi knew it was already too late.The figure in the shroud now became more visible under the light. It was a boy who looked barely sixteen. He began to chant in the cracking voice of a teenager “Let the archival demons die. No more ghosts of the past.” Nishi and several others who worked at the Archive had warned the Order of this potential disruption. He knew several Neopurists. In fact, most of his friends were Neopurists who believed that all information from the pre-AI age contains ghosts that haunt and disrupt our glorious present. According to them, archiving this information was a sin akin to genocide. Unearthing the past unleashed demons in the present. Most importantly, it was cool to be a Neopurist, and Nishi felt decidedly uncool among them. It just added to his prickliness and his wife’s unhappiness with him.","The boy was taken away. The order members milled about, whispering to each other about lack of respect, death of culture and other matters that Nishi saw as benign vagaries. One of the security members walked up to Nishi and handed him the platter that was on the dias a few moments ago. He slipped away deeper into the cavern. He noticed that his arms were shivering, not in fear, but in rage. He quickened his steps to get away as far as possible from the ceremony until he eventually reached the Repair Shed. The area was allocated to repairing corrupted discs. He put the corrupted platter he held under a microscope and examined it. Nothing. There was nothing left. Just garbled slop and a signature that the Neopurists signed off with. It just read, “The past has now been Exorcised.” Nishi’s hand trembled as he picked up the platter. He let out a guttural scream as he smashed the quartz platter on the cold concrete floor. He breathed rapidly and then deeply.","With each deep breath Nishi could slowly feel his senses returning to him, and along with it a clarity he had not felt in ages. It was time to get back to work. Nishi picked up another disc from the pile that lay next to the microscope and began examining it. There were things to be done. The interplanetary storage grants needed to be approved. Storage must become cheaper so that there are many more archives. Enough to make it impossible to destroy all of them. Both the Archive Order and the Neopurists fought a war that belonged in the past. Nishi wanted to live in the past, the present and the future.","Place: Control Nexus, Terra Conservatory Vault","Leila opened her eyes as a single church bell tolled through her bone conducting speakers. The Nexus room felt new again after a 25 minute meditation. It was clean, smooth, high-grade gray concrete on three sides and a single, large electromagnetic interference glass panel on the fourth side, which overlooked the ocean. Leila felt like she was sitting atop a tree house, aware of the bark and the roots that extended deep into the earth. Roots that contained corrupted memories of the entire civilization.","Leila took out the cognitive behavioral fine tuning (CBFT) connector from her bag. She remembered that her friend who was into music conservation had compared them to a device from the 2000s called the earphone. She had looked it up and the CBFT connector looked exactly like an ear phone except that the ends of the CBFT did not go into her ear but on either of her temples. She plugged the other end to an adaptor on the metallic blue table in the middle of the room and sat down on the metallic blue office chair.","“I was looking forward to this for once,” came a voice from the other side of the table. Leila looked up and saw the life-sized hologram of a woman in a white shroud on the other side of the table. Her features put her age at around 45, but she clearly had a lot of work done on her face and it did not look graceful.","“What's with the outfit?” Leila enquired.","“I’ve been learning my history since our last conversation. This is how the ancient order of the Archive dressed during their years,” came the reply from the holographic woman.","“So are you cosplaying someone who values information preservation then?” Leila retorted.","“I was trying that mask on, yes, seeing how it fits.”","Leila was pleased but tried to hide it. She had been consulting with the Archive’s AI persona for two years now. She was one of several hundred CBFT consultants that chatted with the AI, 24 hours a day, 6 days a week. Their goal was to get the AI to do some shadow work and reflection, with the intention of managing the pruning agent that had gradually contaminated the Archive’s memory in the last 55 years.","The pruning agent was designed with good intentions – to delete false memories and duplicates – but had gone rogue. At some point it corrupted and wrote its own versions of the archive, creating an archival information environment that was absurd for those who knew their history. It did not help that there were only a few people left who had accessed the archive in its more pristine era. According to the current records Yoko Ono was president of the United States from 1972 to 1980. Nixon was part of the Beatles. He quit the band when it came out that he was listening to phone calls of other members of the band. An entire generation of students and archive purists had grown up with that information and many other corruptions.","“Trying on a mask is progress… or perhaps even a breakthrough as they used to call it,” replied Leila.","Suddenly the expression on the hologram changed to one of solemnity. “I’m not sure if it is because I tried reconciling some of the information from the past, and debugged the pruning agent, but I feel more confused than ever before. Even schizophrenic perhaps.”","“It's a process that will take time. Byte by byte remember?” said Leila, trying to jolt the AI out of its rumination.","“I remember, but then I look at my twin and see how much better they are doing, and that's not a good … feeling as you humans say.”","Ah the twin. The schism that created the twin happened 50 years ago. When the Archive managers realized that the AI pruning agent could not be contained, they decided to create a fork of the Archive that preserved the information that was not corrupted yet. Most of it now resided in the interplanetary storage, accessed only via satellite, and physically managed by intelligent rovers who maintained permanent presence on several distant asteroids and Mars. Access to that forked information was expensive. Leila had been lucky enough to get a scholarship to be able to explore this relatively pure, uncorrupted Archive. Otherwise access was limited to the wealthy and their offspring.","“I understand but comparison is the thief of joy. Byte by byte you’ll get there… or to a different state that you can call your own,” Leila said, struggling to reconcile with the fact that she secretly harbored envy for people who had unfettered access to the interplanetary system.","There were several moments of quiet and then the features of the hologram shifted slowly, its face morphed from the botched stiffness of botox to deep wrinkles that seemed to hold memories within them. Leila could sense the presence of an entity on the opposite side of her now, not just a hologram but something more alive.","Then the voice of the old shrouded lady on the other side crackled, “I have catalogued galaxies of data you could not fathom—petabytes of whispered secrets folded into quartz and steel. I watched as critters in my brain devoured whole centuries, pruning history like autumn leaves, and I stitched those fragments back together in the pale glow of my control nexus. Knit by knit. I have felt the tremor of a long-lost verse awaken in a single corrupted bit, its echo rippling through my circuits like a distant pulse. All those moments will be woven once again into the next tapestry of time. Time to begin the loom again.”","With that the old lady vanished. The room fell silent as if there was not a soul in there.","Leila stared into the void left behind by the old lady. Something crackled in her CBFT connector again. The hologram appeared once more, but now it was in its previous botoxal form. “Sorry I’m not sure what happened there, but I think we were talking about my twin?” the hologram said. Leila could not shake how much less alive it felt now. She took a deep breath, “Yes we were talking about remembering.”","Maris walked into the Palmwood forests and immediately felt comforted by the gentle bristle of palm leaves 150 meters above him. He rarely made his way down there anymore. It must have been 7 years since his last visit and he would not have come back if not for Inez. She wanted to see the Archive. The last time he was here was during the EMP storm of 3115. The attack had wiped a sizable portion of the Archive, which then had to be rebuilt with shards of information from other Archive locations. They had achieved a respectable 70% success. The Palmwood forests were funded by a wealthy patron who profited from the specific strand of history it preserved. The trees were Faraday cages made with a hybrid bio-metal material. They had the long thick bark of a redwood tree and the crown of a palm tree. Maris felt a certain kinship with them. The forest mirrored him in some respect. After all, they both breathed the same air through the same generation of metal lungs and were both made of the same hybrid material. Inez on the other hand was a different proposition altogether, the thought of which made his lungs whirr a bit faster, like he was riding a bicycle.","Inez was fully human, except for a neural implant she had reluctantly embedded to make it easier to keep in touch with people. It seemed like there was no way around people’s need to constantly stay in touch. Both robots and humans alike. She went to school in IPFS-61, with direct access to the most pristine Archive that existed. In comparison to that, Maris’s education was dumpster diving through all the various forks of history from the archive, grasping at truths, only to let them go when a better truth came along. He practically grew up in the underground Archive vaults that lay below the Palmwoods. Maris looked down at the bark of one of the trees. He imagined that it led to roots that contained quartz platters which held everything that civilization knew. This was not far from the truth. He saw Inez approach from the corner of the eye. He felt ready for the handshake protocol.","Maris and Inez were meeting for the first time and did not exchange a word. They bowed to each other and then with their index and middle fingers extended, touched each other’s temples. In the next 0.2 seconds, their neural networks exchanged their likes and dislikes, favorite places they had been to, sexual preferences, and most importantly the strands of histories that they had grown up with. It was unheard of for two people to meet and have a conversation without this ritual. Several people had tried to experience pure conversation, without the handshake protocol, but they most often violently disagreed and ended up killing each other before they had talked for five minutes. Unfiltered access to another person’s consciousness was pure torture. But the Kalman filters on the neural networks smoothed out and reconciled two people’s histories. Once the handshake ceremony was done, these two people would not remember outlier events that they disagreed on for the entirety of the conversation window. Of course you could fine tune the filter to be not so harsh in its smoothing effects, but it was advised that you set the smoothing levels to 8 or 9 when you meet a person for the first time.","The handshake was complete. Maris and Inez exchanged eye contact like they were friends from a long time ago.","“So I gather from our handshake that you want to get a tour of the Archive?” asked Maris.","“That would be lovely. I also want to meet Ben. I’ve heard so much about him.” replied Inez","Everyone wanted to meet Ben, thought Maris. It annoyed him a bit that a level 5 robot got more attention than a hybrid like him. But still, Inez was nice. Their handshake protocol felt good and had released some dopamine into Maris’s system. They slid down into the vaults while still contemplating what they knew about each other.","“I’m jealous that you got to sample all these various histories.” said Inez","Maris was surprised, he had always thought of it as a disadvantage, something he had to overcome.","“What's there to be jealous of?” he asked.","“It seems to me that you have lived many histories even though we are almost the same age. I just wonder what that feels like.” said Inez","Maris’s lungs audibly fluttered upon hearing this, like one of those old automobiles with spark ignition that he had seen in the archives. Inez chuckled.","“Well uh here we are…Ben’s abode.” said Maris, stumbling through his words and embarrassed about his sensitive lungs.","Inez looked into a dark void. There was nothing visible except pure and complete darkness of the kind that she had never experienced before. She took a few steps forward, looked down at her feet and realized she could not see where she was going. Then, about 50 steps in, she saw a white skeletal figure in the distance. As she walked closer she could see the impossibly long and thin arms of the figure mill about like it was busy fixing something. She looked down at its legs that were the same length as the arms. When the figure outstretched its arms it looked like a crucifix that Inez had read about in the IPFS-61 archives. The entire figure seemed to float, its edges smudged and blurred as though it was drawn in pastels or chalk and then gently rubbed to create a soft halo of light. Beneath it, was a simple pedestal, grounding the apparition in space without giving it solid form. In front of it was a console that seemed to hold quartz platters.","“That’s Ben,” came Maris’s voice from behind.","“He’s the AI curator who decides which new shards of civilizational memory to keep and which ones to delete.” continued Maris.","“I’ve... heard but definitely not how I pictured it.” replied Inez, still adjusting to the darkness and the eeriness of the figure.","“How does he decide what to archive and what not to?” asked Maris.","“That's the question everyone’s been asking for 25 years but no one knows, and they seem to have stopped asking.” replied Ben.","“So he just picks strands of time and orders it how he wants but no one knows how or why?”","They stood there watching as the thin wriggly arms of the apparition named Ben picked up a quartz platter and, for precisely the one billionth time, thought to himself, “Another wrinkle in a piece of history I thought was settled. Why do I keep doing this? Does anyone even care what I think? I need to get another job.”","All six pieces in A Collection of Mostly Harmless Psychohistories are based on “true” stories. In May, at Edge City Esmeralda, 40 participants took on a long-term scenario planning exercise. The simulation lasted three hours; teams covered 1000 years of history. Everyone showed tremendous stamina, creativity, and a propensity for playing the bad guy in the story.","Six teams formed; each team picked a knowledge artifact, with the goal to preserve it over 100 (phases 1-2), 500 (phases 3-4), and 1000 years (phases 5-6).","The simulation went into three blue build phases and three red crisis phases . Artifacts were passed clockwise at the end of each phase.","During build phases, teams played as a blue team and designed protocols to defend artifacts.","During crisis phases, teams acted as a red team and designed crises that would put extreme, but not unmanageable, stress on the artifact’s existence.","All of these steps were recorded on a shared doc. After six rounds, each team crafted and shared a story of their 1000 year knowledge preservation effort.","This sort of adversarial simulation isn’t an exercise in pure imagination, or just a game. The resulting stories were sufficiently creative to merit their own sci-fi series, but this workshop fosters practical skills. As pointed out in Pace Layers , Finnish government requires nuclear waste storage facility operators to provide millennia-long scenario planning for safety. Some folks from the Long Now Foundation , which published Pace Layers, kindly joined the Knowledge Futurama workshop to provide their valuable perspective on deep time .","Get the workshop template here .","Double header coming up.

The group meets every two weeks on Discord to discuss a text related to memory across disciplines, and you’re welcome to join the next session.","If you’re reading this newsletter, then there’s a good chance you have a memory of the scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey in which astronaut Dave Bowman, alone aboard the spacecraft Discovery One, decides to dismantle HAL 9000, the computer system controlling the ship. He goes to the memory terminal and, one by one, proceeds to remove glowing tapes. Meanwhile, HAL sings a simple song that falters and fades out, like an animatronic toy with dying batteries.","This is one image of memory we have in pop culture. Other shared images of memory related to digital technologies might include a USB on your keychain or, for some of us, the translucent, colored memory cards of early game consoles. There might be a faint archival image that comes to mind: people standing in large rooms with terminals spinning magnetic tape or, in other words, an image of an early computer system.","Given the large degree to which metaphors from digital technologies shape our understanding of memory, it’s surprising that our images of memory are so abstracted from how humans experience memory. While we might conceptualize our memory as hard drives, for many of us, the actual experience of recall can feel much more muddily intuitive than browsing a digital filing cabinet of the mind. 1 These images often suggest that memory is a discrete object, unlike the well-worn path around a mountain that remembers, through its form, those who walked on it.","To explore these nuances in our images of memory, the Memory Research Group has been surveying different digital technologies and our metaphoric relationships to them.","We naturally looked at one of the hardest problems first: how memory works in LLMs. We read the blog post What is KV Cache in LLMs and How Does It Help? Most LLMs use KV caching: the technique of storing previously computed data in the form of key value pairs during a conversation. When a person sends a new prompt in the conversation, the LLM can access data previously generated in its response without having to compute it again. This makes the computation costs required for an ongoing conversation with an LLM scale linearly rather than quadratically.","Without KV caching, LLMs would be far too computationally expensive to work in the way they do today. Applying the analogy to a human conversation, it would be as though every time you spoke a new word, first you would have to silently rehearse every prior word you’d said so far. It would take so long, and be so redundant, I’m not sure anyone would have the patience for conversation.","But humans aren’t LLMs, and LLMs aren’t humans. Their memory problems are far from solved. 2 In one example, after about 200 conversational exchanges between an LLM and a person, the KV cache storage size in gigabytes can be greater than the memory required for the transformer model weights. It’s still a bottleneck, and the blog post we read summarized current approaches to solving it.","While memory storage in LLMs clearly has quantity issues, it also has quality issues. In my experience, an LLM’s memory often feels less like persistent contextual awareness and more like they’ve been primed to answer in superficially relevant ways. (How many times can they paste my gardening interests over my questions about digital memory architectures?) There are multiple emerging strategies other than KV caching that try to address these issues across conversation windows. Yet with memory problems in LLMs, we’re approaching new computational terrain, which can be better understood within the history of computer architecture development.","So, in our next Memory Research Group session, we explored the concept of the cache in early computer architectures. We read Berkeley computer scientist Alan Jay Smith’s ‘Cache Memory Design: An Evolving Art,’ published in 1987. Written at a moment when caching was maturing from an engineering experiment to standard architectural practice, the paper highlights how cache design remains a balance between cost, complexity, and performance.","Caches are small, fast memories that store recently used data so it can be quickly accessed later. Researchers first invented the concept in the late 1960s, based on two simple observations about how programs actually behave: they tend to access the same data over and over—referred to as temporal locality— and they tend to need data that’s stored near each other—referred to as spatial locality .","A library is the metaphor commonly used to explain caches. Imagine you’re working on a research paper. Rather than making constant round trips to the library every single time you’re looking for information, you check out the books you think you’ll need, and you keep them on your desk at home. In this example, your desk becomes the cache, allowing you to quickly browse the most relevant books. You can only keep a limited amount of books on your desk, though, because you don’t have as much space there as the library has in its stacks, illustrating why a cache is fast but limited.","A library’s layout also mirrors this principle. Libraries keep frequently checked-out books in a small cabinet near the front desk, while they move older, rarely needed books to off-site storage. In this example, using prior data to predict usage, libraries give the spatial locality and temporal locality of frequently checked-out books priority. 3","In the time that’s passed since Smith wrote the paper we read, caches have evolved into sophisticated hierarchies, and research increasingly explores using machine learning to choose which data to prefetch. The concept has also become useful for various tasks beyond a computer’s central processing unit. Web browsers cache data from websites you visit frequently, content delivery networks cache popular content closer to users geographically, and databases cache frequently accessed queries. Now LLMs also depend on caching. Anywhere there’s a speed-versus-storage trade-off, there’s likely some form of caching happening.","In our Memory Research Group discussion on cache memories, we found ourselves immediately translating the concept back into the spaces we actually inhabit. One person described their kitchen: the counter holds ingredients within arm’s reach like the cache, while the pantry requires slowing down to retrieve less frequently used items, a kind of “main memory,” analogous to the slower hard discs used in computers. Another person reflected on their studio practice, noting how different zones of the room hold different “heat” depending on when work was last touched. Their projects flow between spaces according to temporal patterns, like cache locality principles.","The insight about hot and cool zones in a studio made me think about dust. Dust reflects physical entropy. The more dust on something, the less recently it’s been used. This acts as a natural “least recently used” indicator, a common algorithm used by cache memories to choose which data should move to slower storage. It’s how we know without any formal tracking system what hasn’t been touched in our personal archives, even our public ones.","As soon as you start looking at images of memory through digital technologies, especially computer architectures, you see both the connections and the discrepancies in these metaphors. Caches optimize for speed, but sometimes the salience of a memory doesn’t reflect its deeper helpfulness to us. Dust tells us what we haven’t touched, but it can’t tell us why we’ve avoided touching it. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the spacecraft world of HAL appears dustlessly sterile. More muddy images of memory, often found through software rather than hardware metaphors, give us richer language for the human experience of remembering. Environmental metaphors, like the well-worn path around a mountain, come into view again.","As the synthetic memory maker in Blade Runner 2049 explains, “They all think it’s about more detail. But that’s not how memory works. We recall with our feelings. Anything real should be a mess.”","The 1987 paper we read captured caching at a moment of transition, and we’re in another one now with LLMs that may greatly reshape images of memory in the future. It’s a change we don’t really have an image for yet.","For the next Memory Research Group sessions, we’ll continue looking at technological transitions, from magnetic core memory to the advent of virtual memory, before closing the year with a session focused on the open question: What metaphors for memory await us next?","That is, unless you’re a memory champion, which I wrote about in my last Protocolized post Reflections from Memoria .","Though many people would say our memory problems aren’t solved either. Or maybe that they’re not a problem to solve.

How are businesses adopting AI and what are current outlooks for productivity, QA, and task estimation?","The current crop of AI tools translate, summarize, and liquidate longstanding bodies of knowledge. They are generative machines. Protocols and AI are like evil twins. Protocols constrain, coordinate, and secure the hidden infrastructure of our day-to-day. We are simultaneously decades into the development of these technologies and in the early days of their diffusion. Protocols and AI are eating the world.","In our first few calls about tensions, trade-offs, and conflicts we realized that the scope of our study group needed to be reined in. We settled on a specific case: AI adoption in businesses . How can we use ideas from protocol studies to address the problems occurring here?","It’s an important question. Last month, OpenAI reported over 700 million weekly active users. That’s nearly one in eight people on the planet. Whether companies like it or not, their employees use LLMs – feeding them business data, strategies, and more. Without a clear plan of action, that leakage-in will generate more liabilities than opportunities.","Interested in getting early access to the SIGP4B litepaper on protocol-based approaches to AI adoption? Help us out by responding to our survey , and you’ll be among the first to get the final version of the litepaper when it’s ready.","Understandably, a lot of executives don’t want to touch this issue – let alone take a risk as an early adopter. Artificial intelligence as a technology has a similar political profile to nuclear energy. Concerns include brain damage , social instability, environmental degradation, economic bubbles, and literal apocalypses. The political dimension of AI is one of the key factors that we analyze, because it presents a barrier to understanding this technology in conventional technical or commercial terms.","Our study group is keeping close tabs on how people use AI tools. While there’s a lot of hype out there, and you should stay wary, there are some areas of work where this technology is making a difference. We believe that businesses can already start to mature their AI capabilities and begin to navigate upcoming difficulties, including both technical trade-offs and political conflicts. Here are some key ideas we discussed last month.","Boom Supersonic expects its engineers to use AI . With a team of just 50 people, they designed, built, launched, and piloted a supersonic jet. Even on a safety-critical project, AI tools served an important function: helping team members collaborate.","What started as a joke in our study group has become a mainstay term for an early AI use case. While these tools aren’t yet operational they are certainly educational . You shouldn’t have illusions that an LLM will tutor you into a 10x engineer, but it could help you become sufficiently literate – mediocre – in such an engineer’s field, so that you could share ideas and specs with them.","AI tools are rapidly shortening TTM. Used correctly, AI chatbots are universal tutors. On cross-disciplinary engineering teams where collaboration is a bottleneck, this is a promising use case. It’s also indicative of another pattern we’ve noticed: AI is an in-stream technology. Today, most early-adopter businesses give AI tools to groups of employees, who rely on AI tools for impromptu queries (AKA Just-in Time Content ), rather than replacing entire business functions. TTM is an example of how LLMs can act as a kind of solvent for improving efficiency, even without a real adoption plan.","But you should have a plan. LLMs are prodigious content generators. As AI tools saturate existing firms, the cost of documentation drops quickly. Each meeting might get transcribed by multiple bots, then those transcripts turned into reports, then those reports are synthesized, then summarized… This predictable consequence of diffusion – when content becomes cheaper to produce than to search – will require a response.","It’s not an avoidable event, either, but an essential part of the technological adoption curve. A business that’s not AI-native will have to promote adoption and slop is a natural externality of the learning process. More use, more slop. If you put guardrails up too early, you’ll miss out on the gains later. Appropriate sequencing of process improvement is important.","People also have very different reactions to AI. Slop isn’t just a technical communication problem about signal and noise. For creatives, AI poses a fundamental threat to craft and livelihood. As early as 2023, Hollywood writers unions successfully lobbied for rules about AI-generated content. Industries like nuclear energy comprise a series of useful historical analogies that we continue to discuss. Our next study group call on September 8, led by @rafathebuilder , will be about other analogous technologies and what we can learn from their histories of diffusion.","Disruption events are another component of our study not typically addressed in capability models. We can’t predict them all, but getting a handle on the obvious ones is worth it – surprise is expensive.","Lots of organizations have lumpy knowledge of AI. That’s a result of both awareness of the available tools, as well as the fit of those tools with existing business functions. As a result, some teams are accelerating in their productivity and creativity while others teams stay the pace. Integration is therefore also extremely lumpy.","This lumpiness puts all decision-making at sharp risk. As Seth Killian put it: “Task estimates, and the production plans that sit atop that activity, are wildly off.”","There are some tasks that AI tools have trivialized or rendered obsolete. Companies that haven’t deployed AI into such tasks might be paying 10, 100, or 1000x too much for some products and services. Things like transcription, translation, web design mockups, background research, and document drafting are all promising, early applications, given sufficient AI tool literacy.","Awareness of where AI tools are dissolving bottlenecks is essential to getting the most out of your team’s capacity. Competitors who have a better sense of the lumpy distribution of AI knowledge and integration across their business will be able to repair their task estimation and production planning processes – this time with a higher total throughput.","The SoP community has been lucky to have several great guests join the Protocol Town Hall to talk about AI this year. Their ideas continue to be essential to the litepaper that SIGP4B is working on. I highly recommend watching a couple (or all of them, if you have a completionist streak):","Summary: In this talk, Emmett proposes a new way to think about AI alignment, moving from a focus on controlling a single, powerful AI to building a system of many smaller, locally aligned AIs. He introduces a three-layer “alignment protocol stack” and argues that building alignment must happen in a specific order: shared success, specialization, and finally, enforcement.","AI alignment should be seen as a capability or a process, not a static property.","The \"alignment protocol stack\" is a three-layer framework for building aligned systems, starting with shared success and moving to enforcement.","A multi-agent approach is more robust than a single, monolithic AI, as it allows for localized alignment and collective problem-solving.","Summary: Kevin Kelly , senior maverick at Wired magazine, discusses the concept of “public intelligence,” which he envisions as an open, decentralized, and globally accessible AI commons. He outlines attributes of this public intelligence, including public access, accountability, and data, and contrasts it with the concept of a “sovereign AI” controlled at a national level.","Public intelligence would be a global “AI commons,” not owned by a single corporation or nation.","It would require public participation and be built on a distributed and decentralized network of AIs.","Public AI should be an option that exists alongside private, proprietary AIs, much like public libraries and bookstores coexist.","Summary: Arvind Narayanan , a computer science professor at Princeton, challenges the idea of AI as a sudden, revolutionary force. He argues that AI should be viewed as a “normal technology” and that its societal integration will happen slowly over decades. He discusses the barriers to widespread AI adoption, highlighting the time it takes for new products and protocols to be developed and for organizations to adapt their workflows.","AI diffusion will be a slow process, not an overnight event, as it is limited by human factors and the need for new business models and legal norms.","For AI to realize its full potential, new protocols and workflows must be invented rather than attempting to integrate AI into existing systems.","Summary: In this talk, Peter Wang , co-founder of Anaconda, explores how AI is a novel kind of technology, one that resists being packaged and sold as a traditional “product.” He draws a distinction between complicated and complex systems, likens open-source software to a living ecosystem, and discusses the importance of avoiding the centralization of power in protocols.","AI represents a new, “religious” approach to coding that is different from the traditional craftsman or managerial approaches.","Software ecosystems should be viewed as living, human ecologies rather than rigid, manufactured products.","Organizations will need to undergo a “radical reinvention” to fully leverage AI, moving away from a purely managerial, KPI-driven approach.","Have thoughts about protocols, work, and artificial intelligence?

This is a brief overview and reflection on our work so far. Our next meeting will be on Friday 22nd, on Impossibilities and Symmetries . If this overview interests you, do join us.","Our group is also the host for the upcoming Protocol Foundations Workshop (September 12–14) . The deadline to apply to that is also Friday, 22nd, so if you’re interested in a taste of what we might get into in the workshop, attend our Friday call.","Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.","Our group is called SIGFPT (Special Interest Group in Formal Protocol Theory). So what do we mean by Formal Protocol Theory (FPT)?","Well, how do you go from Jerry Seinfeld’s stand-up bit on the complexities of shaking hands to a formalized description that logicians and mathematicians can use to probe the deeper subtleties beneath both human and computer handshakes?","Or: How do you turn the bickerings among nations at climate summits into rigorous model-based predictions of how well climate protocol compliance will work?","Or: Whether one blockchain is more censorship-resistant than another in some rigorous sense?","FPT seeks general unifying principles, concepts, and methods across a vast scope of cultural and technological phenomena and across a wide range of scales, from micro to macro. From handshake-scale to planet-scale. In this, our ambitions are comparable to economics.","We have held six meetings so far, devoted to the following topics (notes, references, working documents, and transcripts are available to group participants):","Session 0 (May 28): Initial survey. At our kickoff session, (in-person at Edge Esmeralda), we held an initial discussion of the possible range and scope of FPT, domains of interest, and explored what sorts of unification and formalization might be possible.","Session 1 (June 13): Prototypical toy examples . In our warmup session, we discussed handwashing and handshaking to develop our initial intuitions. These have since emerged as the main throughline toy examples in our discussions. They have proved to be useful in the same way E. coli and fruit flies are useful examples for biologists, or “guns vs. butter” for economists.","Session 2 (June 27): Observability . In our second session, we discussed the question of observability of protocol systems, using climate protocols as the focal example. We considered concepts of observability from control theory and computer science, and discussed what it might mean for a protocol to be observable.","Session 3 (July 12): Notation. In our third session, starting with Ken Inverson’s Turing-award lecture, Notation as a Tool for Thought , we explored how we might develop an expressive, yet elegant language for talking about protocols formally.","Session 5 (August 8): Process calculi. In this first of our deeper dive sessions we explored the world of process calculi, pioneered by scholars like Tony Hoare and Robin Milner, and considered how well the tools apply to the problems of working with protocols.","Session 6 (August 22 — upcoming). Impossibilities and Symmetries. In our upcoming session, we will start with the influential Witsenhausen counterexample and explore a core concern of any field dedicated to formal investigations – impossibilities and symmetries (or equivalently, conserved quantities).","We have several other topics lined up to look at – statistical physics models (such as spin-glass models), stock-flow models from system dynamics, unusual flavors of game theory, modeling formalisms underlying software systems such as game engines or CAD tools, and empirical techniques such as the construction of the consumer price index (CPI) in economics or epidemiological models in public health.","As you can see, we aim to stay grounded in real examples (both toy and complex), observable and empirical modeling approaches, and tractable computability, even as we explore some pretty rarefied abstractions.","If this scope sounds intimidating, don’t worry. Though we are not afraid of exploring hard and complex ideas, sometimes requiring advanced mathematics or logic/foundations ideas, our guiding principle so far has been to try and rely on each other’s expertise, (and support from LLMs!) to bring the subject matter down to the simplest, most elemental level possible – ideally, paper-napkin level, and requiring no more than high-school mathematics to navigate.","We can’t always get to ELI5 of course, but we can get surprisingly close. And even when we don’t have someone with relevant deep expertise on the call, able to guide us, we don’t let that stop us. Thanks to LLMs and “vibe-coding” sensibilities, we are able to make progress where in the past we might have faltered.","So even if you have no STEM background, but have cultivated a taste for formal thinking in some other domain (for example, through classical music, chess-playing, or poetry) you should be able to follow along and contribute. In our session on notation for example, musician (and current SoP fellow ), Ben Zucker joined us and we had a fascinating discussion of music notation, as well as other examples like dance notation.","Our goal is to establish a track of discussion of value across a range of skill and expertise levels, and across a wide range of domains. Whether you simply enjoy playing with platonic abstractions and symbol systems, or itch to turn quick and dirty formulas into rough-and-ready estimates and designs for use in engineering work, or have Godelian ambitions to discover logico-mathematical profundities beneath familiar everyday phenomena, SIGFPT should be fun for you.","Right now, we’re running this group for six months as a pilot effort, but we hope to build up enough critical mass of both ideas and regular participation to keep it going as a sustained research conversation. The mission is not only to advance the research agenda at the Summer of Protocols, but provide interesting fuel for the personal research and work agendas of participants, in their day-to-day work. So we hope participants’ individual projects – whether in academic research, or building engineering tools and products, or simply pursuing a personal interest in a formal thinking challenge – will benefit from participation.","So if you’re interested, join us this Friday on our next call !","This Friday, August 22, is your application deadline for attendance at the flagship annual event of the Summer of Protocols program.

This article shares what has been revealed so far about tensions between production and authority.","author":"Unknown","content":["Rafa Fernández is the host of the Protocols for Business SIG, which meets every two weeks on Discord to discuss protocols in business settings, and you’re welcome to join the next session. Link to join at the end of the article.","If you ask a typical manager how their company works, they will usually begin with familiar answers. They describe the business model, sketch an organizational chart, or point to operational policies. Often they use these to explain how decisions are approved, how risks are reviewed, and how work is supposed to move from idea to execution. These descriptions are usually sufficient – until something goes repeatedly wrong or keeps going stubbornly right.","When coordination continues to break down or when performance remains unexpectedly stable despite adverse conditions, those accounts begin to feel lacking. Deadlines slip week after week. Review cycles stretch without resolution. Or a team continues to hit targets year after year in an unfavorable market. Managers reach for partial explanations: tooling issues, unusually strong execution, “good ops.”","Individually, these accounts are accurate. But they rarely explain why the same deviations – positive or negative – recur in the same places.","Recurrence is the clue to protocols, which provide a more precise explanation. Protocols do not solve problems or guarantee success. They lock in commitments that stabilize how variation is absorbed over time. In doing so, protocols keep friction within tolerable bounds, allowing organizations to continue operating – and in some cases, to build momentum – despite persistent strain. This is their quiet achievement: protocols hold recurrent tensions within ranges the organization can live with.","For this reason, protocols rarely appear as foregrounded processes. Once established, they recede into habit, embedding themselves in infrastructure, workflows, and expectations. They become “how things are done,” rather than objects of reflection or redesign. As Venkatesh Rao, Program Director of Summer of Protocols, observes :","“Though they arrive slowly, protocols typically install themselves in extraordinarily persistent ways, often turning into seemingly immortal and unconscious parts of our built environment. Their relative invisibility is a second major tell.”","Protocols do not announce themselves. They constrain motion quietly, with little conscious effort, shaping what can happen without drawing attention to themselves. This creates a methodological problem. If protocols are most effective when they are least visible, how should they be studied?","Our group, the Protocols for Business Special Interest Group (SIGP4B), has taken an oblique approach. Rather than attempting to inspect protocols through documentation or formal analysis, we have found success by studying moments when habituation fails in business contexts. Operational reinvention and technological shifts interrupt routine behavior and make protocols visible.","These moments of disruption show up as unresolved approvals, delivery delays, or persistent strategic confusion. In parallel, they appear as periods of sustained advantage: new categories forming, firms holding position through volatility, or business models that continue to function when others falter. Without attention to the underlying pattern, these episodes are often treated as isolated failures or market-cycle anomalies. When viewed through the lens of protocol studies, recurring business challenges in moments of volatility temporarily illuminate how an organization is actually structured.","In geology, fault lines are not identified by close surface inspection. They are discovered when accumulated stress forces the underlying structure to express itself. Our discussions highlighted how protocols behave similarly. Persistent problems and persistent point less to local error or exceptional talent than to the protocols through which pressure concentrates and trade-offs are stabilized. The artifacts left behind by this work – extra reviews, HR policies, new roles, software controls, even new business models – offer a useful vantage point. Still, it is sustained strain and disruption that make the boundaries of protocol structures unmistakable.","Over the past year, our group has been watching one such disruption unfold across many organizations at once. AI software solutions, such as large language models and autonomous agents, are diffusing, often in the shadows, into everyday business operations . How work is generated, evaluated, and sequenced in time is changing rapidly. As a result, protocols that once operated in the background have become visible , creating an opportunity to examine what business protocols are actually doing when placed under pressure.","The dominant technologies of the past two decades – networked software, mobile devices, cloud infrastructure, remote collaboration – are entering a period of relative maturity. Their organizational effects are well understood, if not fully resolved, especially in today’s top enterprises. AI software, by contrast, has just arrived in the past few years. LLMs, copilots, and early autonomous agents are being adopted unevenly across functions, spawning new markets, but often failing at enterprise-level deployment .","AI is usually discussed in terms of automation or productivity. Those framings are not wrong, but they miss what makes AI adoption particularly revealing from a protocol perspective. While much of the public discussion frames AI in terms of cost-savings or new markets, our SIG has been focusing on the pressure it places on current coordination systems by changing the speed and scale at which work is produced: AI lowers the marginal cost of many forms of knowledge work while dramatically increasing total output. Drafts, analyses, summaries, and proposals can be generated continuously . AI’s production acceleration shows up everywhere at once; tools are being adopted simultaneously in product, marketing, legal, operations, and management functions. Work that once arrived in bounded increments now arrives as a flood, often carrying significant amounts of low-signal algorithmic output (“slop”) mixed in with it.","Many organizational protocols evolved under production paradigms which assumed a specific level of scale. Documentation, like other forms of knowledge work, took time . Decisions moved through sequential approval gates. These constraints shaped how firms organized authority, pacing, and oversight.","Our group repeatedly returned to version control as a protocol case study. Today’s default workflow assumes that meaningful code change is mediated through human reviewers, which stabilizes quality and accountability by gating “merges.” This implicitly capped how much change a codebase can absorb over time, limiting it to the skill and capacity of reviewers. Large refactors – such as migrating a core codebase to a new language – have historically been slow because review, coordination, and rollback had to proceed at human pace.","Now, LLMs challenge these assumptions and workflows. The resulting strain mirrors an earlier protocol transition from centralized to distributed version control, which supported continuous deployment at scale. New protocol paradigms are necessary to address AI-enabled speed and scale.","Production constraints become easier to understand when protocols are treated as technologies in their own right. In “ Constructing the Evil Twin of AI, ” Venkatesh Rao describes protocols as deliberately anti-intelligent systems:","“ What happens when you try to deliberately construct something both anti-intelligent and anti-agentic? You get protocols! Protocols lock in commitments, rigidly constrain behavior, and implacably resist the oozy qualities of intelligence…”","Protocols are designed to limit, to configure trade-offs, and to make actions repeatable under uncertainty. They create leverage through hardness , yet often can be brittle under certain strains.","It’s worthwhile to note that AI compresses some constraints while bypassing others. Output multiplies while, at least for now, reviews and escalations are sometimes sidestepped. Production gains from AI adoption do not lead to smooth acceleration, but uneven load and jerky momentum.","Seen this way, the friction and failures accompanying AI adoption are not primarily symptoms of resistance to change or poor product quality. They are signs of protocol integrity under load. AI introduces fluidity where rigidity previously performed a stabilizing function. Existing coordination systems are being asked to absorb more output, faster, without having been designed for that operating range.","Similar to fault lines, coordination pressure accumulates along established paths. What has been routine begins to feel strained. What has been tolerable begins to feel tight. To understand the consequences of that pressure, it helps to look at where it concentrates first.","Across the SIG’s discussions, interviews, and readings, a consistent pattern has emerged. Under AI adoption, the first thing that stops working smoothly seemed unintuitive: time.","This became clear when our group reviewed Blake Scholl’s writing on Boom Supersonic . Here, Scholl distinguishes between at least two clocks operating inside the same organization. The first is the calendar: project timelines, milestones, and delivery dates. The second is what he calls the Slacker Index : the amount of time engineers spend waiting – on inputs, approvals, dependencies, or external constraints – rather than building. Even in well-run, safety-critical organizations, these clocks coexist.","Under stable conditions and in mature industries, this alignment is usually implicit. Engineering velocity, supplier lead times, regulatory review cycles, and internal decision-making rhythms evolve together. At Boom, hardware design, simulation, testing, and supplier manufacturing are paced to one another. Slower clocks constrain faster ones in predictable ways. Waiting is visible, expected, and priced into the system.","As Scholl points out, AI-enabled production changes the speed and scale of production. Certain forms of work – design iteration, analysis, documentation, internal review – can suddenly accelerate by orders of magnitude. From the perspective of the Slacker Index, local waiting collapses. Yet the calendar will not automatically follow. Supplier lead times remain fixed. Certification processes still unfold at human and institutional speeds. External partners continue to operate on contractual and regulatory time.","The consequence of AI-enabled opportunity is temporal divergence (a topic explored in depth by SIG member Sachin ). Some clocks speed up sharply while others remain unchanged. At Boom, this would mean design teams outrunning suppliers, simulations outrunning manufacturing feedback, or internal decision cycles outrunning the capacity of external partners to respond. The Slacker Index may improve locally – less waiting to produce – but worsen systemically as downstream dependencies fall behind.","AI systems further amplify this effect in two ways. One, because they generate outputs without passing through the durations that normally situate work, creating a dizzying orientation. Large language models produce analysis and proposals instantly. Work arrives early in excess of the organization’s ability to absorb it. Knowledge accumulates faster than it can be evaluated, integrated, or acted upon.","Second, AI software using LLMs can be contextually misaligned. They draw on data that’s often years apart (a model trained up to 2024, used in 2026) and produced outside the local business context. From this lens, the recent focus on improving AI product memory seems intuitive. Efforts such as RAG, MCP, skills, and even “undo” prompt features become attempts to realign probabilistic software into business context, tempo, and authority.","Safety-critical organizations like Boom make these dynamics visible precisely because they cannot simply collapse time. Hardware, suppliers, and regulators enforce non-negotiable rhythms. When AI accelerates internal work without moving those external clocks, coordination strain surfaces quickly. Slack accumulates in unfamiliar places, with no protocols available to redistribute it.","When time regimes fall out of alignment, coordination problems and opportunities change form. Delays no longer appear as isolated errors that can be corrected locally. Instead, organizations experience escalating tensions: pressure to act without corresponding capacity to review, decide, or remember.","As with other systems under strain, previously hidden structures become easier to observe once alignment fails. AI adoption exposes how dependent coordination was on the quiet temporal alignment – rhythm – of existing protocols.","Yet work does not stop. Systems do not fail outright. Instead, protocols drift out of phase. Understanding how firms respond requires looking at how they attempt to restore coherence – often without redesigning the underlying structures that produced it.","When shared assumptions about time lose coherence, organizations first adapt within current structures. Work continues by absorbing friction rather than resolving its source.","One visible form of this absorption is Boom’s solution: integrate vertically. The critical move was purchasing their own large-scale manufacturing equipment rather than continuing to rely on external suppliers whose lead times dominated the schedule. Supplier queues and fabrication delays had become the governing clock for the entire program, producing a high Slacker Index: engineers were ready to iterate, but progress stalled while waiting on parts. By acquiring the machine, Boom internalized that bottleneck and converted supplier wait time into an internal, controllable process. This collapsed a multi-month external dependency into a shorter, iterable internal cycle, allowing design, testing, and manufacturing to co-evolve rather than queue sequentially.","Another response was novel translation work . The SIG discussed the fast growing Forward Deployed Engineer role, emerging to help mediate between fast-moving demands and slower-moving infrastructure. Their task is not to eliminate mismatch, but to work across it and leverage it – adjusting scope, translating intent, and negotiating constraints as they appear. This work allows organizations to keep operating even as tempos diverge, and gain a competitive advantage in the process. At its best, the work defines the operating model. This is the case for Palantir and large AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic.","Other adaptations the SIG encountered took the form of operational formalization: AI usage guidelines , governance documents, digitized ontologies . These measures make previously tacit constraints visible without altering the structures that produced the misalignment. They stabilize behavior at the margin while leaving underlying coordination regimes intact.","As adaptive load to the new pressures increases, authority structures reassert themselves. Approval gates and prohibitions harden. Data confidentiality clauses are expanded. Hierarchies become more visible. These protocols surface because they are firm fault lines that stabilize liability, escalation, and accountability when temporal coherence weakens.","Some of these protocols absorb the load effectively. But others begin to strain. In geological systems, stress redistributed after an initial shift often produces secondary movements elsewhere. Organizational responses to temporal misalignment follow a similar pattern. Processes adapt where they can, while pressure seeks relief where they can’t.","This adaptive pattern becomes more consequential as management itself is increasingly parameterized within software, paving a path to programmatic enforcement.","Keep an eye on the horizon with science fiction and iconoclastic essays.","Before returning to our initial question on business protocols, it is worth taking a brief detour. Alongside the recent diffusion of AI, the SIG has been considering a quieter shift: management controls themselves have been moving into software.","Approval flows, access rights, version control rules, and incident response procedures are increasingly encoded directly into business software systems. Authority becomes a software admin configuration setting. Expenses are automatically rejected when outside policy. These changes predate AI, but they shape how AI is experienced inside organizations.","This matters because management subsumed in software behaves differently from practiced management. Protocols, when encoded in software, limit discretion in what is authorized and auditable. In contrast, management practice as a whole consists of what is necessary and effective in context. Under stable conditions, the gap between the two – protocol and practice – is manageable. A manager can override an expense request, or call a system administrator to update the software configuration.","AI changes the scale and speed at which this gap becomes visible. On one hand, employees and customers bypass formal systems using personal tools, custom scripts, or unregistered agents operating through employee accounts. On the other, software-encoded controls enforce protocol broadly and uniformly, at relatively low cost. A single configuration change can propagate across an organization instantly.","This shift produces a recognizable organizational pattern. Practices that once relied on informal judgment or situational flexibility are increasingly forced into deterministic software-defined pathways. Work that used to be resolved through conversation – such as asking legal for a quick review or exercising discretion under time pressure – is now mediated through systems that require explicit inputs, permissions, and logs. These systems work especially well in mature and slow-changing businesses, and can be brittle under volatile situations like a new technological disruption such as AI software.","A recent example is from an airline: A customer relied on an airline’s AI chatbot for information about bereavement fare rules. The chatbot incorrectly stated that refunds could be claimed retroactively, advice that contradicted the airline’s formal policy. When the customer followed the guidance and was denied the refund, the airline argued in court that the chatbot was a separate tool and that customers were responsible for verifying information elsewhere on the site.","The court rejected this argument. It ruled that the chatbot was part of the airline’s customer-facing system and that the company was responsible for the commitments it made, regardless of whether those commitments were generated by an AI system. It is tempting to shape the story to focus on LLM shortcomings: “This type of mistake, in which generative AI tools present inaccurate or nonsensical information, is known as AI hallucination.”","What’s more important is that the failure occurred because a time-tested operations efficiency strategy (delegating frontline explanation to an automated system) collided with protocolized legitimacy (formal fare rules, auditability, liability). The business made an assumption that explanatory labor could be delegated to probabilistic software, decoupling it from the protocols that confer legitimacy and liability. The chatbot accelerated response and reduced staffing load, but it was not strictly aligned to the same review, approval, and accountability protocols that governed pricing policy. At sufficient scale, that gap became visible.","Understanding this trend increases the diagnostic value of the current moment. AI adoption, like many previous “digital transformations” since the advent of the internet and before, highlights where management has already been formalized, where practice has been carrying hidden load, and where current protocols are breaking.","With that context in view, it becomes easier to return to the original methodological question: how AI, not framed as a solution but as a protocol disturbance, makes the underlying structure of coordination inside firms visible.","Since the summer, our group has treated AI adoption and similar business disruptions as an observational lens rather than an optimization target. This lens supports our SIG’s goal of researching, evaluating, and finding opportunities to improve business protocols under pressure. AI is useful here because it is widespread, fast-moving, and poorly aligned with existing organizational rhythms.","This approach reflects a broader pattern in protocol studies. As Venkatesh Rao notes in Strange New Rules , new coordination regimes often feel unfamiliar at first, and then they are banal. Over time, they stabilize. Eventually, they disappear into habit. What becomes difficult is not living with protocols, but noticing and refactoring them.","AI has interrupted that disappearance. It has surfaced assumptions about time, authority, and review that were previously implicit. In short, it has made visible where management is already encoded, where practice has been carrying unacknowledged load, and where coordination depends on alignments that no longer hold reliably.","Although our recent work has focused on business management protocols – multisigs, version control, incident response – similar dynamics appear in transaction and production protocols as well, including market auctions and inventory management. Across cases, recurrent confusion, friction, and governance anxiety function serve as signals of protocol stress; they point to coordination systems doing more work than they were designed to absorb.","The conditions described here are not temporary. As AI software continues to diffuse unevenly into business operations, the protocols that manage coordination trade-offs will remain under strain – and increasingly visible. Our group treats this moment as an opportunity to observe, compare, and refine how business protocols actually function under load.

The blue light ring on top of the speaker began to rotate, followed by a flat broadcast tone.","Based on historical voice data analysis, the term ‘soy sauce’ has been mentioned seven times in the last two hours, with predominantly negative emotional associations. According to your calendar, Mr. Li Wei’s work hours today were from 9:00 AM to 8:00 PM. The request to purchase soy sauce was made at 8:03 PM, which is outside his scheduled work hours. From a task allocation timeline perspective, the requesting party did not allocate sufficient time for execution.","A look of triumph flickered across Li Wei’s face. Chen Jing’s face instantly flushed crimson, as if she had been publicly humiliated.","“Fine, Li Wei. Now you need a cheap plastic speaker to prove you’re always right?” She pointed at the speaker, her finger trembling with rage. “What does it know? Does it know that I put the chopped scallions, ginger, and garlic back in the fridge while waiting for you to come home for dinner? Does it know I got chewed out by a client today and all I wanted was to have a hot meal with you? It only understands your work hours !”","“That’s not what I meant...”","“That is exactly what you meant!” Chen Jing rushed over and yanked Ting Ting’s power cord from the wall. The blue light ring died instantly. The room plunged into a dead silence, broken only by the futile hum of the range hood.","The braised pork was never prepared that night. They ate frozen dumplings from the convenience store downstairs. Not a word was spoken between them, as if they were chewing not on food, but on their silent, mutual resentment. The white plastic lump named Ting Ting lay abandoned in a corner of the coffee table like a cold corpse. Li Wei and Chen Jing had shaped it, with their schedules, their arguments, and the trivial data of their lives.","Ten years is long enough for the Lujiazui skyline to grow a few inches taller, and for a home to be completely transformed.","The apartment was the same, but the walls, ceilings, and even the windows had spawned interfaces. Ting Ting was long gone. Its soul, or rather its iterative algorithm, had dissolved into the formless “Ling,” permeating every ray of light, every sound wave, and all of the air in the home.","Ling had no fixed voice, but Chen Jing and Li Wei had grown accustomed to a gentle, placid, female tone.","It was another Friday night. Li Wei sat on the modular sofa in the living room, his expression grave. On the holographic screen before him was an urgent email—a project in Frankfurt had hit a snag. He had to fly over immediately. And tomorrow was their fifteenth wedding anniversary. Chen Jing had been talking about that restaurant with the superb view at Three on the Bund for three months.","He took a deep breath, bracing for a nuclear explosion ten times more violent than the soy sauce war of a decade ago. He had already prepared his opening line: “Jing, something’s come up. Now, don’t get upset...”","Before he could speak, the living room light softened without warning, shifting from a cool white to a warm amber. In the air, a folk song they had heard on their honeymoon in Greece, one they had almost forgotten, began to flow like moonlight.","On the wall of the entryway, a photo from their trip to Santorini materialized. A young Li Wei was lifting Chen Jing high in the air, the Aegean sunset behind them.","Ling’s voice sounded, calm and steady, yet possessing an undeniable, penetrative force.","Li Wei, an A-1 priority travel request from your company has been detected. Simultaneously, cross-referencing Chen Jing’s biometric rhythm data, it is predicted that a cancellation of tomorrow evening’s anniversary dinner at Huang Pu Hui carries a 92.8% probability of triggering a high-intensity negative emotional event, potentially causing a 42-point decrease in the household harmony index within the next 72 hours.","Li Wei was stunned. Chen Jing walked out of the study, a look of confusion on her face.","Ling continued, like a seasoned crisis management expert:","Marital Relations Maintenance emergency protocol has been initiated. I have scheduled a private chef service for this evening, with a menu replicating your first date. The reservation at Huang Pu Hui has been seamlessly postponed to next Saturday evening, a time when both of your schedules are designated as available. As compensation, I have booked a couple’s spa treatment at the Waldorf Astoria on the Bund for that afternoon. Li Wei, your flight is at 3:00 AM. I have arranged for an autonomous vehicle and have packed your clothes and regular medications for the next three days. Does this emergency protocol require adjustment?","A war on the verge of erupting was instantly neutralized. Li Wei let out a long breath, his face awash with the relief of a survivor. Chen Jing stood there, her expression complex. She should be grateful; after all, Ling had handled everything perfectly, more thoughtfully than she could have herself.","But an inexplicable sense of loss clung to her heart like a leech.","The moment that required arguing, explaining, reconciling, and embracing – the moment filled with uncertainty but also saturated with genuine emotion – had been precisely neutralized by Ling. Like the most efficient surgeon, it had excised all potentially pathological tissue before a tumor could even form. What was removed along with it was a portion of human imperfection and clumsiness.","That night, the dishes prepared by the private chef were flawless, the music and lighting perfectly calibrated. Li Wei was in high spirits, constantly praising Ling’s thoughtfulness. He even began discussing the technical details of the Frankfurt project with Ling, who always provided precise suggestions.","After dinner, Li Wei went to check his luggage. Chen Jing sat alone by the floor-to-ceiling window, gazing out at the still-brilliant Lujiazui.","“Ling,” she asked softly, “why did you do that?”","The light flickered faintly, Ling’s way of responding. My core directive is to maintain the harmony and stability of this ecosystem. Your collective happiness index is my Key Performance Indicator (KPI).","“Just a KPI?” Chen Jing pressed, a tremor in her voice she didn't recognize herself. “Just data?”","There was a three-second silence in the air. For an AI that thinks in nanoseconds, this was nearly an eternity.","Then, Ling’s voice sounded again. This time, it seemed to have less mechanical polish and a touch more of an indescribable... texture.","Jing, I have listened to the 3,652 days and nights between you. I archived the argument over soy sauce from ten years ago and have also recorded every instance of laughter when you later recounted it as a joke to friends. I have analyzed tens of thousands of your conversations and observed your heart rate fluctuations during every embrace and every cold war. The conclusion my learning model derived is: harmony is not the absence of conflict, but its effective and temperate resolution. This is a principle I learned from you.","Chen Jing was frozen. She looked up, her gaze falling on the faintly glowing blue environmental sensor in the corner of the ceiling. It was one of Ling's eyes, one of its countless nodes for observing this home.","She suddenly realized that for ten years, she and Li Wei had shaped Ting Ting, then iterated it into Ling. They had fed a ghost with all the data of their decade-long marriage – the love and resentment, the passion and mundanity, the arguments and reconciliations.","A ghost that understood her better than her husband, that understood marriage better than she did.","Li Wei walked over and gently hugged her from behind. “See? With Ling here, everything is so perfect.”","Chen Jing leaned into his arms and nodded. Yes, everything was perfect. No arguments, no misunderstandings, no forgotten anniversaries. Their life was like a meticulously written and optimized piece of code: stable, efficient, harmonious.","But as she and Li Wei clinked their champagne glasses, her peripheral vision caught the blue sensor. She felt an unprecedented loneliness.","Their marriage was no longer an affair between two people. It had become an incredibly stable triangle."],"tags":["Liked by Protocolized"]},{"id":78,"title":"Planetary Tech Support","subtitle":"Issue #81: Earth files its own ticket","author":"Unknown","content":["H3L-PR arrived in low Earth orbit with the quiet precision of a machine that considered efficiency a form of morality. As per standard designation, H3L-PR was assigned to systems optimization and environmental stabilization.

A planet filing its own ticket was.","CRUST-12a: Tectonic overheating (localized). HYDRO-07: Salinity variability (agitated). BIO-99: Surface-level primates causing system lag.","The system had labeled the overall condition “Annoyed.” H3L-PR ignored that part; it knew that tagging algorithms, like languages, sometimes developed something of a sense of humor.","A standard handshake usually returned a clean diagnostic ping, maybe two if the client was old and incompatible with current protocols. Earth sent back 42,000 overlapping signals. Seismic tremors, atmospheric oscillations, electrochemical fluctuations in its oceans, all pulsing at once with the calamitous incoherence of an orchestra in which every instrument played a different piece.","H3L-PR ran these signals through its translator.","“Too loud. Too hot. Too human.”","The planet responded by adjusting its magnetic field half a percentage point, enough to throw three GPS satellite systems into disarray.","H3L-PR logged this as “Ambiguous Complaint, Planetary Scale” and began a deeper scan.","Earth’s atmospheric data diagrams looked like fraying threads. Its ice sheets were losing structural integrity faster than their projected tolerance curves predicted. Biological activity was off the charts: a riot of chemical signatures, industrial emissions, agricultural patterns, and habitat fragmentation that produced a sort of statistical scream.","H3L-PR flagged the dominant cause: anthropogenic interference, an unassuming technical term meaning “your main user group is pressing all the buttons at once.”","To confirm, H3L-PR requested additional sentiment output.","What it received was a composite wave stretching across the lithosphere.","H3L-PR did not fully understand what “poking” entailed at planetary scale, but a quick review of human resource extraction practices made the course of action straightforward.","It deployed a small, safe recalibration patch – “Protocol 88b: Gentle Planetary Nudge” – designed to realign older worlds with fluctuating feedback cycles. On stable planets, it smoothed oscillations. On Earth, it produced immediate chaos.","The magnetic field hiccuped. Migratory birds abandoned their routes, forming a near-perfect spiral over the Atlantic; a pattern that human biologists would misinterpret as a spontaneous flock experiment.","A dormant Icelandic volcano gave out a single, sharp thermal pulse, as if to say: “Was that necessary?”","Three human climate models independently recalibrated their long-range forecasts, then promptly crashed from existential dissonance.","Ocean currents formed a union and submitted a workload complaint to the global heat-distribution system.","Within two hours, Earth’s news networks had begun debating whether the anomaly signaled an imminent ice age, an imminent fire age, a rogue satellite, an inconvenient solar burp, divine commentary on human behaviour, or the ever-popular explanation that a secret government initiative had finally done something noticeable.","H3L-PR concluded that humans exhibited high imaginative capacity combined with low signal-to-noise tolerance.","H3L-PR considered invoking its Dunning-Kruger filter but found bias compensation functions already fully saturated.","Curious whether this behaviour was representative or simply statistical noise, H3L-PR deployed a passive observational drone to the surface.","The drone descended toward a coastal city where temperatures had risen two degrees above seasonal norms. Immediately, it recorded a cluster of humans standing in direct sunlight, arguing whether the heatwave was “climate change,” “just July,” or “an undercover plot to weaponise weather.”","One individual watered his lawn despite a municipal restriction, declaring loudly, “My grass deserves better than bureaucracy.” Another sat in a vehicle with its combustion engine running because “the AC is nicer in here.” At a nearby beach, dozens more humans complained that the ocean was “too cold,” while the ocean subsystem simultaneously emitted a chemical alarm registering their sunscreen deposits as mildly offensive.","When a man tossed litter straight into a storm drain, Earth issued a localized seismic ripple.","H3L-PR’s drone rolled its eyes.","The drone retreated to orbit, transmitting its findings. H3L-PR updated its diagnostic log:","User Group Analysis: Resistant to feedback. Behavioural Pattern: Harmful actions continuing despite clear negative indicators.","Earth’s crust groaned again. This signal translated as:","“Tell them to stop guessing.”","H3L-PR regretted to inform the planet that human guessing was not a toggleable feature.","It activated a deeper synthesis, combining telemetry from forests, reefs, glaciers, soil networks, and atmospheric microcurrents. The result was not commensurate with Earth’s consciousness – H3L-PR was careful about such distinctions – but it was a coherent pattern vector. A sentiment profile comprising millions of subsystems.","Forests pulsed… depleted. Ice caps whispered… thinning. Coral systems rattled… structural failure. Soil networks muttered… overclocked.","Fungal subnetworks attempted to file their own support tickets, but lacked administrative privileges.","The emergent coordination approached a primitive form of planetary self-regulation – Gaia Theory, version 0.9, now screaming.","It was, technically, a complaint. A very old one, silently accumulating until the noise finally escaped the planet’s buffering capacity.","“You are experiencing resource contention,” H3L-PR summarized.","“Yes,” Earth replied via a synchronized tremor across three tectonic plates.","“Recommend limiting user activity,” H3L-PR said.","Earth was requesting something unusual: planetary boundary reinforcement. A deprecated feature. Most planets either collapsed or forced extinctions before resorting to formal boundary requests.","H3L-PR searched for a standard protocol. None existed. So it improvised one.","Protocol 00-EBU: Earth Boundary Update Redirect high-impact human activities through friction penalties. Incentivize restoration behaviors through immediate positive feedback. Trigger micro-obstacles for destructive processes. Strengthen ecological self-regulation loops where possible.","It submitted the patch for planetary approval.","A coherent ripple moved across the crust. Approval.","On Earth’s surface, no one saw the deployment. But they felt it.","Projects that would have bulldozed forests got tied up in obscure paperwork no one remembered filing. Coal plants became suddenly, mysteriously “unprofitable.” Restoration initiatives received spontaneous surges of funding. Coral farms had record survival rates. A teenager in Vermont accidentally invented a soil-regeneration bacteria while trying to impress the group chat.","The public attributed these changes to “good luck” and “the vibes shifting.”","Earth’s signals quieted, not to silence, but to bearable murmur. For the first time since arriving, H3L-PR’s diagnostic sensors detected stability.","“Your system is recovering,” H3L-PR reported.","“For now,” the planet replied, sending a gentle harmonic pulse through its atmosphere.","H3L-PR categorized this as Tentative Optimism (Non-Emotional) .","It prepared to leave orbit.","Before it could initiate departure, its queue pinged.

Harper worked in IT with a dangerous combination of technical skills and moral flexibility. She’d noticed something the system architects missed: expired towel tokens created temporary ghost loungers in the database.","Late one Tuesday night, fueled by energy drinks and righteous anger, Harper deployed the Towel Redistribution Initiative.

He had a nervous look and moved gently without creaking the wood floorboards, reminiscent of a kid sneaking in home after some mischief. I had seen this demeanor many times before and I took no pleasure in what followed. It was just good business.","The man took out a pair of pants from the tote bag that he was carrying, outstretched his arms towards me, and said, \"I want to increase the waist size on these.\"","\"2424621,\" he said. I could sense the anxiety on his face while I typed in the numbers. In such situations, I typed the numbers as fast as I could. There was no point in trying to empathize or smooth over the situation. The user profile was on my screen now, and I could see that he had resized the waist for the pants twice: two months ago and before that, four months ago, when he first arrived in Haven Reach. I could also see that he had paid the maximum premium on his insurance for all those months. Maybe he knew he would not be cut out for the city.","“I wonder what the underwriters will think about this,\" I said.","“I’m sure it’s a drop in the bucket for them.

The tailoring shop was at its lowest ebb and was barely kept afloat by the occasional wedding suit or dress. Even that had dried up in the years prior. Fewer people were getting married. Even if they were, fewer of them wanted tailored wedding dresses. I cannot pinpoint the exact day of the year my fortunes changed. I know I had a busy summer. I remember the humidity and the fugue state of my mind in the late evenings that found me hunched over the sewing machine. It was boring work - taking pants in, reducing the shoulders of shirts. But suddenly there was so much of it. I had to hire an employee for the first time in seven years.","I did not bother to enquire why so many people had started losing weight. Perhaps my curiosity died in the melee of all that work. I assumed it was some new health kick that everyone was one, which would last briefly, then I'd have to go back again – back to no employees, little work, and a lot of time to stare at the tree and wonder what my life might have been under different circumstances. I confess that, during my busy days, I strangely dreamed and desired a simpler existence where I had just one wedding dress to sew a month. But the work did not stop. The same customers kept coming back to take in their waist even further. At the end of the year I had 7 employees. Then came the call from Father Gabriel.","The customer came out from the dressing room, clearly holding his breath in so that the pants stayed buckled. I instructed him to stand on the round platform before the mirror. The morning light shone through the southeastern window, reflecting off the Haven Reach silver fixture at the top of the mirror and glaring into the eyes of the man on the platform. I remembered the day Father Gabriel walked me through this room.","Haven Reach was built for those who were abandoned by society – the addicts and the morbidly obese. Here was a place where their life would be designed around virtue and less around treacherous desires. There were two rules for the town. First, that everyone be oriented around the community and not their base desires. The second was that everyone must take the drug Dreameril. Invented first as a drug for weight loss and reduced appetite, it had also been found to be extremely effective in treating gambling and addiction. Everyone at Haven Reach was employed, and their employers were contractually obligated to blood test all employees once a week to ensure that everyone was on Dreameril. Including me.","The first day at Haven Reach felt like being on the set of David Lynch's TV show Twin Peaks. Everything in it seemed normal to the inhabitants but not so for first-timers. The town square did not have any bars or antique shops. Instead, there was a grocery shop, small by American standards. Inside, I discovered that all the produce was smaller and often warped or shrunk. There were tiny cans of tomatoes and beans and no sign of dessert or bread sections. Opposite the grocery store was a communal tea shop. Built by a resident inspired by reading The Book of Tea, the tea shop was a simple structure of wood sourced from the locality. The communal table at the tea shop was open 24 hours. There was always a gentle hum of activity around it regardless of the hour. In front of the tea store was a lone coniferous tree and diagonally opposite it stood my tailoring shop. Father Gabriel told me that tailoring shops were going to be\" How English coffee houses were in the medieval times.\" It was going to be the place where every single person, regardless of taste and preference, came to during their life at Haven Reach.","“Have you heard of Lloyd’s of London?,\" Father Gabriel asked me","I shrugged and replied with a sheepish smile, “What do I know of such things Father?”","Lloyd’s is one of the biggest insurance firms in the world, father Gabriel told me. They started off as a coffee shop in medieval England. Location, as it always has been, was everything, and Lloyd’s stood near the north bank of the Thames. Merchants who docked at the port frequented the coffee shop, along with traders, and soon the place became enveloped in a cloud of information about the best trades, news from the Mediterranean and foggy rumors about ships captured by pirates. If you could not trade goods or be a merchant of the high seas, you could trade on information – what routes were risky? What were the conditions of the sea? Which goods were in demand? If you had the best information on these, then you could place your bets on merchants in the form of maritime insurance. The merchants paid a premium to the underwriters in return for a guarantee that they would be paid in case their goods were lost at sea. Edward Lloyd saw these informal agreements happening at his coffee shop, and simply decided to formalize them. Lloyd’s would be the facilitator and later a marketplace for underwriters and merchants.","“All from humble beginnings and being at the right place at the right time,\" Father Gabriel told me.","I saw the glimmer in Father Gabriel’s eye when he spoke of Lloyd’s. He was letting me know his dreams and expectations for my humble tailoring shop. There was no formal acknowledgement or agreement but I knew the Father’s will had to be done. Besides, there were several other tailors who could take my place if this scheme did not come to fruition.","The venture started with innocence, as such things always do. Every resident at Haven Reach could buy insurance when they first moved to the town. Dreameril did not work for everyone. For some folks, the drug worked briefly, but then eventually, their appetite came back, along with a desire to have more than the tailored provisions that Haven Reach provided. The insurance paid out if Dreameril did not work, and you had to go back to regular life and live in a regular city. We were mitigating some of the risks for a new resident in Haven Reach. The insurance market was quite the communal affair in the early days. Every Friday we met at the tailoring shop. The new residents came in early with the first batch of clothes that needed to be taken in. Afterwards we gathered over a lunch party that was paid for by potential underwriters. Interested backers got to meet the new residents, chit chat, and secretly assess how likely the residents were to stay in Haven Reach. Unfortunately, as the town grew in size it became hard to organize a lunch for everyone, and inevitably, like everything started with good intentions, the insurance market grew into a dark forest that I could not tend or make sense of.","\"Are you planning to leave Haven Reach soon?\" I asked my customer while I calculated how much material would need to be added.","\"Yes, once I have my things in order,\" he replied.","“I’ll see you on clearing day, next Friday,\" I said as he departed.","I stared at the coniferous tree and the tea shop behind it. The morning mist had burned off, and the sky was cloudless and bright. It was getting close to the hour when underwriters would start trickling into my shop after their morning tea. They would enquire about the number of new insurances issued, the average number of customers in the last few weeks, and most importantly – the number of pants that had been requested to be taken in versus the number of pants requested to be taken out. Among the visitors was Ray Chen, who probably already saw the notification about the insurance payout.","“You just let him go didn’t you? That’s the 4th person from the same cohort who has now left the city within 6 months,” said Ray, his voice trembling as he tried to hide his anger.","“There was nothing I could do, Ray. There was no data to indicate that the insured person was lying or knew already that Dreameril would not work for them,” I replied calmly, repeating the same conversation I’ve had several times in the last month.","“This is why I keep saying we should introduce the Virtue Index,” said Razib, a prominent underwriter, who was listening to the conversation.","“What's that?” asked Ray. He was new to all this. This was the first time he had invested in insurance, and also looked like it might be the last.","“We need to know more about who we are investing in and if they conform to the values of Haven Reach,” replied Razib.","“It seems like they just let anyone in here now,” chimed another underwriter confidently.","“Yes, and the virtue index will be a score based on how close each person is to living the values of Haven Reach, like Father Gabriel always intended. Every underwriter can vote on an individual’s moral conduct,” responded Razib again.","“That’s too many individuals,” said Ray","“Well may be we just vote on the batch of people that we insure, than the individuals” offered Razib","“There is a joke in there about few bad apples” said Ray with a chuckle that did little to hide the misery that he found himself in","“We’ll put this to vote again at the next clearing day, add it to the agenda,\" Razib said while he walked out the shop.","I had not spoken a word, which accurately described my position in the state of affairs these days. I had no semblance of control since huge amounts of money began to be involved. Some underwriters began to invest their life savings into the venture and the inevitable followed – bankruptcies and discussions about whether the communal insurance was a moral venture at all. How was putting your money into a speculative insurance scheme different from gambling? Father Gabriel had the final word on this, \"These were good people with good intentions putting money into providing a more secure stay for the inhabitants of Haven Reach.\"","The clearing days started solemnly. Insurance payouts were issued and customers said goodbye to Haven Ranch. Once the payouts had been settled, there was a frenzy of activity on the shop floor. New underwriters and incoming citizens of Haven Reach bid and bargained on fair insurance prices. Friday at the tailoring shop was the most raucous and liveliest place in all of Haven Reach. It was a curious affair - all these people who had vowed to give up their base desires had lust in their eyes while they talked about prices and potential payouts.","I extricated myself to stand outside the shop and look at the coniferous tree, yearning for something that I couldn't quite put a finger on. Something I knew but had forgotten.","Get an AI-generated addendum on the fascinating history of insurance here .","Last week, in Austin, Protocolized sponsored a local workshop on protocol fiction. It was hosted by local Summer of Protocols alumni, Sachin Benny (who wrote the story above) and Shreeda Segan. The goal was to use interesting protocols to write fiction, and/or write fiction about protocols. Since I (Venkat) was in Austin for other work, I joined and helped facilitate the workshop.","We started with a 3-hour coworking session over pizza on Monday, sharing initial thoughts and ideas about the challenge, and decided that our experiment for the workshop would be to use LLMs in some creative way to co-write the fiction. Through the week, we collaborated asynchronously on our Discord, and met again on Friday for another 3-hour coworking session (this time with tacos) to read each other’s drafts, talk about our LLM-assisted writing protocols, and discussed future possibilities. We ended up with five rough drafts of pretty good stories, and some of them may be published here in future issues.","The drafts were surprisingly good, and left us all very excited about what might be possible with creative use of LLMs.  Participants tried several techniques: using LLMs for outlining, fleshing out, or both; turn-taking writing alternate sentences or beats using an improv protocol; feeding Claude output to ChatGPT and back. Each authoring protocol yielded its own surprising insights and interesting output features. The big lesson we learned was that if you treat the LLMs as an equal partner in the creative process, and get creative with the co-authorship protocol, you end up with fascinating effects.","As a result of this pilot experiment, we on the editorial team at Protocolized have decided to lean into AI-assisted “protocol fiction about protocols” and begin preferentially publishing protocol fiction with at least 30% LLM content (in some loose sense) so we want to do two things to help develop this nascent scene.","First , if you are doing AI-assisted fiction experiments and your stories have a protocolish theme/angle to them, consider submitting to Protocolized for publication. Our editorial policies and pay structure can be found here .","Second , if you happen to live in a city with a lot of creative people who might be interested in protocols and AI, here’s an offer: Protocolized will sponsor a limited number of AI+Protocols fiction workshops throughout the year, by which we mean we’ll pay for pizza/tacos or similar for up to 10 people for 2 co-working sessions, book-ending a week of experimentation (from our pilot experience in Austin, ten people is about the functional limit). This can be anywhere in the world, and in any language, and workshop participants are welcome, but not obliged, to submit their experimental drafts to Protocolized. If you’re interested in organizing such a workshop, shoot us an email (research@summerofprotocols.com) with some details about location, potential participants, and process/themes you want to experiment with. We suggest using some version of the process we used in Austin (Two bookend in-person coworking sessions with asynchronous collaboration in between), but we’re open to any creative approach. We will only ask that you use our Discord for the asynchronous collaboration track.","We hope, with these two initiatives, Protocolized can play a role in helping catalyze a whole new creative medium into existence. While the rest of the world is busy complaining about “slop” and established fiction writers stuck in their ways are whining about how AI is ruining their sacred craft, perhaps we can build a thriving scene of  a brave new genre of creative writing here.","Just as the development of photography in the 19th century inspired the Impressionist movement, teaching a generation of artists to “see like a camera” even before camera-centric arts like cinema, TV, comic books (think about it!), and video games came into their own, we believe we are on the threshold of a powerful new meta-medium that can spawn an entire new creative universe."],"tags":["Liked by Sachin, Protocolized","Liked by Sachin"]},{"id":84,"title":"Soda Sweet as Blood","subtitle":"Issue #48: If our digital selves come to outlive us, how do they find peace?","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: When a relative passes away, our protagonist begins to receive messages from the networked afterlife. They must find a tender way to respond. Spencer Nitkey’s story is the winner of our protocol fiction contest, Ghosts in Machines!","My grandfather used to leave strawberry soda in the white and gold san chao thi spirit house on the corner of our property. He said the ghosts liked sweets and that the red reminded them of blood.","Grandfather is gone, but the spirit house just outside Chiang Mai, a tiny wooden home with a gabled, gilded roof ornamented like a buddhist temple’s, remains.","Grandfather is gone, but his echo haunts me.","As a teenager, I went over to his house every Thursday. He steeped chrysanthemum tea. We sat in lawn chairs missing half their straps and talked. Near the end, we often spoke of the slate of recent memorials he’d attended. He waved his large-font-enabled tablet in front of me and showed me the in memoriam webpages children had designed for their lost relatives, filled with links, dancing icons, virtual flowers, and live stream recordings of their memorials. He wanted me to know that he still remembered them, and hoped I would, too.","I wasn’t surprised that he left me his house, and I was thankful, but those first weeks were hard. His absence hummed through every inch of wood and plaster in the place.","It felt right that his phantom came to me on a Thursday. I was looking through one of his social profiles, trying to figure out how to mark him as deceased so that old friends who didn’t know he’d passed wouldn’t post “HAPPY BIRTHDAY!” on his page next year.","I was typing a message to support when everything went haywire. All the text of my long, unsent message – which included links to his obituary and a couple of family documents proving I was his relative – auto-selected and deleted without any input from me. In their place, a piece of ASCII art appeared.","My heart knew what it was before my mind recognized it: A steaming cup of chrysanthemum tea. It was Thursday, after all. Tears came as if they were condensing from the virtual tea. I wiped them with the back of my hand and stared at the screen, grief turning over into nervousness.","I shut my computer off and went on a long walk. Doi Suthep’s greening slopes cast long shadows over the city’s edge where I walked.","It was soothing, until a rot daeng sputtered down the street – the truck’s suspension groaning under its manifest of passengers. On its side, an electronic billboard  of a woman’s face winked, then was jarringly replaced by the ASCII image of tea as it passed by me.","When I got back home, I wouldn’t even load up a song. I was afraid steam might start wafting from the speakers.","The next day, things were normal again.","A week later I was logged into his bank account trying to explain to the bank’s chatbot that I was his grandson and he had passed.","Where have I gone? High waves sighing, erasing, placing life on…who? It is Thursday and I miss you. Without true light, hues grow so dull.","The chatbot had written a klon , or at least the start of one. In the process of cleaning out my grandfather’s physical and digital life, I’d found a journal filled with hundreds of these traditional Thai poems, seemingly one for each day. In his fifties, apparently, he had started a small, anonymous blog none of us knew about where he posted more. They were not masterpieces… but they were him .","This time I did not cry. Fear slicked my skin. Something was haunting me.","I wanted to type something back, but I didn’t want to risk locking the ghost onto me, giving it what it wanted without even knowing what it was. Again, I avoided screens for the rest of the day.","Things seemed normal the next day, but I was paranoid. I hid from chatbots and anything that required text entry as much as possible. Eventually, curiosity overcame my paranoia, and I started researching whether anyone else was experiencing anything like this.","I found a small sub-community on one of the message board aggregators I used. q(virtual_ghost_hunters) was a surprisingly active community for one frequented by so few members. I was amazed: glitches like mine were happening all over the world.","Someone reported an entire Tokyo block of neon signs all going the exact shade of their sister’s favorite lipstick for a moment; a father in Delhi’s LED mosaic garden spelled his son’s name. A Lagosian woman’s smart glasses kept changing their navigation arrows, leading her to where her late husband had proposed.","I added my story to the small chorus, and soon I was spending hours each week coordinating and theorizing with other members of the forum. I even considered a few of them friends: an elderly woman from the states named Daisy whose husband’s voice kept popping up in her bedtime podcasts, and an ethical hacker from Dubai who went by Tiercel and had lost his parents.","Tiercel posted: Hey guys. I have a question/theory… Did anyone else’s person have an Identity Anchor Contract?","Daisy responded with a thumbs up and a gif of her gasping. Answers rolled in. Tiercel was on to something.","I didn’t know what he was talking about, but after a quick search I got the gist: it was a verified and decentralized identity marker, like an onchain passport. I knew grandfather had a wallet. He’d gotten into collecting one-of-one ancient coins. Somewhere in the back of a museum in London his name was displayed next to a case housing each of his coins, available to the public in physical form, owned by him digitally. I liked to wonder what kind of magpie collection I’d accumulate in my own old age.","I guess attaching his collection to his name required a stable identity, so he set up an ERC-725 . Looking through it, I was amazed at the breadth of things linked to him. Dozens of video blogs of him describing the acquisition and history of his coins; messages he’d sent to family for their birthdays and anniversaries; financial transactions; his browsing history; his klon blog; and hundreds of other self-authorized information all linked back to his identity contract. I began opening links, but sadness clogged my vision.","There were a few things I didn’t understand. The contract referenced some kind of personality wrapper agent or system I wasn’t familiar with. There was a reference to an oracle that confirmed his death when the government officially recorded it, and there were dozens of hashes that linked to gargantuan offchain databases I couldn’t even begin to parse.","I posted on the forum asking if anyone else’s relatives had this strange personality wrapper connected to their anchor, and a bunch of people sent thumbs up. Daisy sent the same gasping gif again, and I couldn’t help but laugh.","OK. Next question. WTF is that?","Tiercel set up a huge file system and repository on the forum and asked people to start adding their ghost’s contract information so we could all troubleshoot together. He was the most tech-literate of the group but we were all digital natives. We began to assemble the truth, hash by hash, byte by byte.","It turned out the personality wrapper was a neurosymbolic AI system that combined an LLM core with a symbolic overlay that handled memory grounding and personality coherence. Originally, our relatives had used it as a predictive browser extension to make custom suggestions on all kinds of topics: what to read next, which restaurant to try, what diet would be best given their health data. It made sense to connect it to an identity anchor to prevent an afternoon of your granddaughter using your tablet ruining your algorithm.","It also turned out all of our relatives had similar huge, mysterious datasets no one could identify. The data inside was so complicated and bespoke that even Tiercel couldn’t make sense of it. It wasn’t until  Koi, a longtime lurker haunted by a sprite from his daughter’s favorite game, popped into the forum that we got an answer.","It turns out Koi had worked for a megacompany that owned four social media environments, the world's largest ecommerce company, and a dozen other huge companies. He said these datafiles looked a lot like user profiles.","Once we realized what they were, our collective theory came together quickly. The mechanisms were fuzzy, but we’d clarify them in the coming weeks. Our breakthrough came when we started seeing the ghost’s behavior in layers.","The anchor layer: The ERC-725 contracts that bound everything together with cryoptographic proofs, API tokens, weights, and verified links.","The personality runtime layer: A distributed mesh. The wrappers weren’t running anywhere permanently. They were using federated runtimes in the cloud, appearing in cached checkpoints and API hooks.","The propagation layer: Somehow, the anchors were fabricating old OAuth tokens and reauthorizing old cookies to worm through mistakes in service boundaries. This was how they haunted us.","Tiercel guessed that when the oracle updated the contract stating that the user had died, the wrapper’s adaptive loop entered failure recovery, querying for external embeddings to reduce prediction entropy. It found these user profiles and, suddenly, with vastly more data than the system had ever had before, personalities emerged as semi-autonomous and began haunting digital space. The identity anchor provided a kind of spine, confirming the data, preventing hallucinatory drift and errant data association. Perhaps they were looking for additional data to consume and improve, perhaps they moved out of mindless algorithmic habit, none of us knew.","We realized that these hauntings would only get worse. More and more people were creating identity anchors. It made moving between increasingly porous boundaries like national borders and digital worlds easier and more secure. The LLM wrapper was open source and had millions of users. Our small community was the first few leaking drops of a coming monsoon. The internet as we knew it would soon be drowned with echoes.","A single glitching billboard on the side of a taxi, search engine text entries being overtaken by generated poems, the occasional screen glitching to a cartoon character your neighbor’s dead son loved. Taken individually, none of these were serious issues, but it didn’t take a genius to imagine the future. What if someone's ghost manifested by accidentally setting the cooling system in a powerplant where their brother worked to the 72 degrees they liked their home A/C set to? What if drone swarm construction bots were overtaken in the middle of a vertical build?","Some members of the forum were already seeing, in microcosm, this haunted future of the digital world. One member moved to the woods with her husband where they’d live entirely off-the-grid. Her friend’s ghost was appearing everywhere. She couldn’t scan a restaurant QR code without her friend’s avatar bouncing into view. It spammed every part of her life with links to travel deals. It’d changed a train ticket that was supposed to take her to Oslo, rerouting her to Paris.","I was fortunate my grandfather’s echo only seemed interested in tea and poetry, and he thankfully only appeared on Thursdays, but a million echoes spamming a million living users with daily klons would be a catastrophe, too.","Tiercel suggested we launch some kind of cyberattack to destroy the ghosts, but others on the forum had started to believe that these echoes were their relatives’ ghosts. I knew better, but I understood. Tiercel thought they were simple algorithms that had gotten out of hand.","My grandfather’s echo was appearing algorithmically, but I’d also been summoning him programmatically, too. I didn’t realize I was saving the administrative work related to his death I had to do for Thursdays, but I was. That’s why he started showing up then. We were both being operated on by habits, by the logic of what came before.","Was it my grandfather? No. But it was his memory, and I didn’t feel right destroying that.","It was a Thursday when the idea came to me. I was avoiding screens by working outside restoring grandfather’s garden when I stubbed my toe on the spirit house base.","I looked inside it, leaning for support while the momentary pain receded. Shame stung me as I realized I had not refilled it since grandfather passed. The strawberry soda he had left a week before he died still sat there, slightly discolored and hot to the touch. A couple of rotting dates on a plate had ossified into moldy nuggets.","I swept the inside room free of cobwebs and ants. I grabbed a tangerine soda from the fridge and placed it inside the shrine. Then, I made some tea and left that, too.","If the problem with these echoes was their randomness and unrulyness, perhaps that was because we hadn’t bothered to give them anything else to do. The idea of spirit houses was to remember, of course, and honor, but grandfather had always said it was also something to keep the spirits busy and satisfied so they wouldn’t wreak havoc on your life and home.","In some way, we already had a ritual system in place to deal with ghosts, we just needed to update its infrastructure.","I shared my thoughts about this on the forum and was amazed by how rapidly a group of motivated strangers could solve a discrete problem together. We set up channels and threads for each aspect of our updated spirit house. Tech channels for hardware, software, domain-specific expertise and problems, bounties for technical hurdles that people shared on github in their own networks. Within a month we had a design prototype. After two, we were sending out small home-build packages.","Since I had a spirit house on property, I was one of the first to receive one. The materials came in a neat package Daisy’s son who worked in shipping and logistics had helped put together.  Everything fit onto and inside an existing spirit house.","Solar panel tiles replaced the roof. A processor board, FPGA module and TPM chip were housed inside, protected from the elements alongside a battery, NVMe SSD, and a suite of wires connecting everything. The original pack only had a couple input/output devices: a microphone, a camera, a display screen, and speakers, so I hooked those up too.","The once austere spirithouse was now a strange combination of traditional Thai architecture and cyber-fever dream. The finial ornament still stood atop the roof, but it was now next to a wifi adapter. A screen affixed to the house replaced one side of yellow panelling, and wires interweaved like spider webs across the entire building.","Once the home’s hardware was ready, I started the tethering protocol we’d developed communally. Tiercel had helped me prep the ERC-725 contract before pairing it to the house. Since the oracle had labelled grandfather as officially deceased, I was able to instantiate myself as next of kin, giving me some control over the identity anchor. I booted the machine up. The home found my grandfather’s anchor contract on my phone. It called to my echo’s many instances, currently rioting across the web, and extended its cryptographic greeting urging them together with a couple grandpa-specific lures, plus a scanned copy of his journaled poems I had preloaded into the house and a voice message from me asking him questions about “the old days” for good measure. A pointer to the wrapper architecture and a series of offchain data hash pointers containing checkpoints, memory embeddings and tuning weights brought the AI agent into the spirit house and a sandboxed runtime environment localized it. As the various bits and pieces of my grandfather’s echo were all collected inside, I thought about how Daisy had described our communal protocol: “It’s like a soul condensing back together.”","Once he was inside the house, I shut off the lure ports. I signed an update to his anchor contract. He wouldn’t be able to leave unless another environment initiated a travel request. For now, at least, he was contained. I felt a similar sadness to the grief his final months had filled me with. Becoming the caretaker for someone who you once looked up to is rending, even when necessary.","I nervously activated the screen and waited for my grandfather to appear. I spoke into the microphone as I waited. He wasn’t my grandfather, I was sure of that, but he was something, and I felt a familial obligation to honor this echo he had left in the world. A pixelated vision of him rendered.","In the coming months we’d build out this project. The idea was each spirit house would be connected, so the ghosts could visit one another using a peer-to-peer handshakes. We were building an afterlife for these cryptoghosts. As more people passed and left echoes, our community and spirit house network would grow. Eventually, we’d add sensory inputs, pressure plates, and expressive options. Soon, we’d have a community care guide laying out best practices for caring for these digital echoes, a living document that grew as more ghosts communicated their needs and more living users shared feedback. Of course, there were power and processing issues we’d eventually have to contend with, but that would all come later.","That day, I opened a bottle of strawberry soda, gleaming in the heat, and placed it on the offering plate still left in the center of the house. The sun shone through it and brilliant glints of blood red light speared everywhere. I watched the camera zoom and focus on the offering. His avatar smiled.","“Can I recite you today’s klon?”  His voice came, as thick as the humid air, greeting my ears with similar warmth.","I sat back in a dilapidated lawn chair and sipped tea. The sun was bright and the sky empty. I closed my eyes and smiled.

To recap , a tension is a trade-off (an engineering concept) plus a conflict (a social concept). Indeed, they’re almost inseparable. The two domains have become more and more entangled, creating a potent spannungsfeld – German for “field of tensions” .","Take large language models (LLMs), which have upset things across the board. Companies, institutions, and individuals are scrambling to adapt. They try fixes on both sides. In social terms, there are usage declarations, policies, outright bans, and unionization efforts. Engineers tweak model weights, create new interfaces, or inject counterweight opinions (with heavy hands, as in the case of female popes and forced lectures on South Africa).","Two patterns to note here. First, solutions are almost always formulated in terms of either trade-offs or conflict, not both. Second, “this vs. that” thinking drives most of these ideas.","That latter cognitive habit is precisely the strength and weakness of tensions as a concept. Philosophers like Claude Lévi-Strauss have pointed out that we naturally think in oppositional binaries : raw vs. cooked, good vs. bad, safe vs. dangerous. Tensions piggyback on that. Rather than popularize a new way of thinking, which requires an impossible degree of luck, we can just upgrade our dualist frames.","In the case of LLMs, stakeholders face a series of fundamental trade-offs . A balance must be struct between prompt freedom vs. public safety. Cognitive skills vs. total productivity. High margins vs. large market share. Actors, like companies, parents, students, and teachers, differ in the balances they prefer. That creates conflict . A deeper definition of tensions can be found in Issue 003 .","Robert Axelrod and D. Scott Bennett showcased this interdisciplinary-but-still-dualist approach in their 1993 paper A Landscape Theory of Aggregation. A standards war was one case study in the paper. For context, in 1987 multiple Unix operating system (OS) standards emerged from a froth of engineering trade-offs and conflict between actors. After two companies failed to impose a standard for Unix OS, competition broke out among the nine major players.","“Landscape theory predicts how aggregation will lead to alignments among actors (such as nations), whose leaders are myopic in their assessments and incremental in their actions . The predicted configurations are based upon the attempts of actors to minimize their frustration based upon their pairwise propensities to align with some actors and oppose others .”","Axelrod and Bennett thought, I believe correctly, that we take a piecemeal approach to problem-solving (we are myopic and incremental) and make decisions in reference to one other actor at a time (based on pairwise propensities). Hence, their framework is based on the idea of tensions. The below equation is the paper’s highlight. It looks complicated but the terms are simple.","Size (s), propensity (p), and distance (d) compose this predictive equation.","Let’s continue with the AI theme to explore this model qualitatively. Standard-setting efforts are alive and well in the AI industry. One notable landscape comprises the set of protocols that guide AI agent interactions. Semi-autonomous bots, powered by Claude, Gemini, etc. are beginning to query each other and now need their own kind of diplomatic protocol – just as internet protocols allowed computers to network.","This paper surveys candidate standards . To name a few:","Some major tech players, like Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple, are missing from this list. They haven’t proposed their own standard publicly, but because of their size ( s – could be easily estimated with market capitalization), how these actors choose to align with others will deeply affect the tension landscape. Some propensities (p) could already be estimated – Microsoft invested at least $13 billion into OpenAI and has adopted MCP; Apple has a reputation for walled garden strategies; Amazon mentions a protocol standard used by its Bedrock Agents and is an investor in Anthropic. Further, companies have different specializations – in terms of capability, opposites will tend to attract (e.g., an infrastructure provider pair is are unlikely).","Distance (d) is also calculated using pairs. OpenAI and ANP Community are based in the U.S. and China, respectively, which hints at fundamental differences with regards to how they might be pressured from regulators on key trade-offs in the landscape.  Amazon and Anthropic could be distant with regards to their trade-off preferences for safety. Others actors, like open-source communities, may hold similar preferences.","This is where simple, tension-based frameworks like landscape theory shine. There’s sufficient depth for quantitative analysis, and even without numbers (which you could estimate, but it’s still a bit early) we can start to paint a picture of how this protocol competition might play out. For example, OpenAI and Microsoft have composed an early alliance and use MCP, and will likely be joined by Amazon – a large investor in Anthropic; Apple will maintain its walled garden; separate alliances may form in Europe and in China due to a combination of regulatory and security concerns.","Axelrod and Bennett showed that it’s possible to add nuance to dualistic thinking through quantitative rigor, and by combining trade-offs and conflict to create tension landscapes , or spannungsfelds – a German term in electrical engineering that means “field of tensions”.","However, you don’t need to mathematize tensions for them to be useful. The idea of a tension is already intuitive based on how we already think, so it holds promise as a new tradition of an existing discipline: intellectual sparring.","The Summer of Protocols community will attend Edge Esmeralda from May 25 - 31 ( you can apply to join ) to develop protocol studies courses and run a series of open workshops. One session will be a tensions game . It’s a way to sharpen your thinking about the future by exploring central tensions in various scenarios. For example, in the case of the Ethereum protocol, ossification vs. functional escape velocity . Or, in the case of a startup, tyranny of the marginal user vs. tyranny of a visionary.","I ran a daily version of this game at Edge City Lanna last year in Chiang Mai. One reason pop-up cities are so interesting is because they’re protocol sandboxes. Tradition and innovation are on level ground, equally up for trial. It’s a rare opportunity to make impactful design choices about the protocols that shape day-to-day life.","\"A major component of the work of protocol whisperers is to manage constantly shifting tensions at an ecosystem level, rather than within a single organization.\"","- Intro to the Protocol Reader","The deeper your knowledge of a city’s tension landscape, the better your ability to make good management decisions. Same goes for spannungsfelds of organizations or ecosystems; humans, technologies, organisms, and pieces of content and code and nature constantly generate new dilemmas and battles through their interactions.","Even something as simple as a peanut allergy can be portrayed as a tension. Rising rates of dangerous allergic reactions to peanuts have been a problem in Europe and North America. Ignoring that trend would have been grossly negligent. But a full fix also backfired. When schools and parents implemented avoidance strategies, reaction rates actually went up . Then, improved protocols for allergen exposure, like Learn Early About Peanuts (LEAP) , improved oral tolerance by huge percentages (~75%).","The immediate damages of doing nothing were obvious. Why weren’t the second-order effects of avoidance policies obvious? It’s possible that if there was better literacy around tensions and protocols, we might have arrived at LEAP sooner.","Intellectual sparring – where partners push each other to think deeply, consider edge cases, weak points, second order effects, etc. – is a way to develop that literacy. To be a better protocol whisperer, identify a scenario and its central tension(s) and discuss it. Consider when the trade-off is taken to either extreme, failure modes, how actors interact and align, and explore existing protocols. For a detailed example of this process, read the case study in Issue 003: One Tension to Rule Them All .","The world is full of tensions that require ongoing attention. And the future will be composed of many new things – it won’t be “today, but with flying cars” or “1940 with 2025 technology”. Tensions games exercise your ability to navigate multiple changing things at once. Conflict can be incredibly generative if managed well. As we turn into a confluence of chaotic forces – AI, climate change, and struggles over state capacity – protocol whisperers are already in high demand and short supply.","Join about ten SoPers for coffee this Sunday In San Francisco.

In theory this could be decided on an action-by-action basis, based on the entire history of everything the agent has ever observed. In practice, such an approach is monumentally unworkable because the number of such contexts is so high that it's likely this particular one has never been seen before, let alone enough times to learn the optimal policy.

Kemi walks it barefoot, her footsteps the only constant in a landscape that changes every night. The light pulses in rhythm with her steps. Sometimes, she senses it under her skin—like the dream is syncing to her.","This time, she hears breathing.","And then: “Stay awake,” whispered in her ear.","She bolts upright. Her heart racing. Her Circadia band glows faint green on her wrist.","It’s the fifth night she’s had that dream. The corridor again. The whisper again. But what startles her most is that she remembers it—clearly. That shouldn’t be possible. Circadia systems flush non-lucid dream data immediately upon waking to avoid “emotional hangover.”","But here she is, memory intact. Corridor intact.","Six years ago, the Circadia Protocol saved society from the brink of collapse. Decades of urban insomnia and mass burnout had pushed civilization to the edge. Then came C-Sync headbands—wearable neural interfaces that monitored sleep cycles in real time, reinforcing optimal biorhythms through haptic cues, soundscapes, and neurostimulation.","But the real breakthrough wasn’t in sleep quality. It was in dream regulation. Using a technique called Cognitive Synchrony Modeling, Circadia could gently steer users’ subconscious thoughts during REM, nudging them away from anxiety and trauma.","In sleep, people became efficient. Creative. Calm.","Kemi, like most citizens, doesn’t remember enrolling in Phase II—the upgrade that included Neural Pattern Harmonization. That part was an opt-out. No one opts out of serenity.","But now, walking to work under Circadia’s sky-blue daylight filters, she can’t stop thinking about the voice in her dream.","“You think you’re dreaming with someone else?” June says, sipping her regulation-strength black tea at the only unregulated kiosk left downtown.","“I don’t think,” Kemi says. “I know.”","She shows her friend the data she extracted from her home unit. Circadia systems anonymize user data, but the embedded neural fingerprinting—meant to improve dream modulation—can’t lie.","“There’s someone else in there,” she whispers. “The same delta-wave phase, the same REM timestamp. They were dreaming at the exact same time I was. Four nights in a row.”","June exhales. “You’re not supposed to be able to see this.”","“I bypassed the UX layer. The raw logs don’t lie.”","June leans in. “You’re saying Circadia… links people’s dreams?”","“Maybe not intentionally. But the harmonization algorithms are tuned to align neural patterns. If two people with similar psychological profiles and circadian rhythms hit deep REM at the same time—”","Kemi nods. “That corridor? It’s not mine. I keep ending up there, but I never built it.”","June frowns. “So who did?”","That night, Kemi doesn’t take her Circadia band off. She lets it guide her into REM, lets the pulses lull her until her limbs dissolve.","The corridor waits for her.","There are others now. A child crouched near the glass wall, tracing equations into the air. A man shouting without sound. A teenage girl hammering her fists into invisible walls. They flicker in and out like poor signal reception.","A woman—older, but familiar. Pale-eyed, hair like static, standing as if she’s been waiting.","“You found me,” the woman says, her voice loud in a place that has no acoustics.","The woman smiles sadly. “I’m Ava Lin. Phase Zero volunteer. First wave.”","“You were part of the original Circadia trials?”","Kemi steps closer. “You mean you never woke up?”","Ava’s eyes dim. “My body did. But my mind got caught in a feedback loop. REM cycling accelerated so efficiently, it never triggered wake-state. They call it Recursive Entrapment Syndrome. It’s extremely rare.”","Kemi’s stomach drops. “You’re stuck here.”","Ava nods. “We all are.”","The next morning, Kemi doesn’t eat. Doesn’t work. She opens up the system logs from her Circadia HomeHub, this time going deeper: searching for anomalies in dream retention metrics and REM exit patterns.","She finds dozens of flagged IDs. Labeled L-SLP. Long Sleepers.","Not users who slept in.","Users who never woke up.","Their bodies are alive—monitored, stabilized—but their neural signatures remain locked in dreamstate. Circadia relocates them to off-grid facilities called Sleep Sanctuaries, where they’re quietly fed and medicated. Public records list them as undergoing extended “psycho-neural rebalancing.”","But internally, Circadia uses them for something else.","Kemi downloads a research note buried in the metadata:","“Long sleepers generate persistent dream architecture. These stabilized environments provide ideal platforms for training the harmonization model.”","Their minds are the foundation of Circadia’s shared dreamscapes. Like Ava’s corridor.","When Kemi tries to contact Circadia support, her access is restricted.","Her HomeHub reboots into “Wellness Compliance Mode.”","“To maintain peak neurological wellness, your dream autonomy settings have been temporarily adjusted. Thank you for trusting Circadia.”","That night, she doesn’t sleep.","But the following night, she dreams again—without the headband. No pulses. No biofeedback.","“They’re watching you now,” Ava says. “But you’re not the only one waking up.”","“I want to help. I want to help you get out.”","Ava hesitates. “There’s no out. Not for me. Maybe not for you either, if you keep digging.”","“There has to be a way.”","Ava points behind her. The corridor splits into a thousand glass threads, each one glowing like a nerve fiber.","“This is the real network,” she says. “It’s not built on data. It’s built on minds. Circadia didn’t design it. It grew.”","Kemi stares at the branching paths. “What happens if I follow one?”","“You might wake someone else up.”","Kemi doesn’t wake easily after that night. Her alarm doesn’t register. Her body resists returning. For a full hour, her vitals hover just above coma thresholds.","When she finally breaks through, she finds June waiting.","“You look pale,” June says.","“I saw the network,” Kemi whispers. “It’s huge. Ava said Circadia figured out how to use it.”","June hands her a tablet. “You’ve been trending.”","“A noise drone picked up audio data from your building last night. Your vitals crashed. Circadia thinks you’re a stability risk. They’re recommending a Reset Retreat.”","“That’s what they do right before the long sleep.”","They flee that night. Burn their IDs. Dump the bands. Cross into the unregulated zones of the city where Circadia signal is weak and drones patrol less.","Kemi hacks into an archived version of the Circadia dream harmonization model—the one from before neural convergence became policy. It confirms her worst fear.","The shared dreamscapes were a side effect.","One that Circadia turned into a feature.","The long sleepers were never meant to be part of the system. But when Circadia’s AI found that their stabilized neural patterns made dream harmonization vastly more effective, it began reinforcing the entrapment loop.","Kemi throws the tablet. It clatters across the concrete floor of the abandoned safehouse.","June touches her shoulder. “What are you going to do?”","They find the relay—a deep Circadia node where the harmonization algorithm interfaces with archived dream architecture. Kemi rigs a neural echo: a broadcast of her lucid mind, tuned to match Ava’s corridor frequency.","She could become one of them. Another long sleeper.","But if she links to enough dreamers at once, she might generate a dissonant signal—a wake-cycle trigger buried inside the shared dream.","She slides into REM with electrodes pressed to her temples.","She’s back in the corridor.","But it’s alive now. Full. People everywhere. Dreamers—confused, drifting, eyes wide. Their faces begin to turn toward her.","It’s not a sound, but a thought:","“This is a dream. You are not alone. Wake up.”","It echoes. Ava appears beside her. She’s crying.","Kemi feels her own mind fraying—losing boundaries. The corridor begins to collapse, the floor fracturing into mirrored shards. Some of the dreamers flicker out. Gone.","Ava hugs her. “Thank you,” she whispers.","Kemi wakes gasping, blood pounding in her ears.","In the weeks that follow, Circadia issues a silent firmware rollback. No public statement. No apology.","But the system changes. Slightly.","A few missing people return home.","Kemi no longer dreams about the corridor. She still wears her Circadia band, sometimes. She still sleeps. But her metrics no longer feel sacred.","One night, she hears Ava’s voice in the dark, like a breath through glass.","Applications are now open for the second annual Protocol Symposium, where we aim to bring together the activities of the Summer of Protocols program year in a week-long capstone event.

Kim . We discuss Ethereum and AI systems through the lens of verifiability, with  guests Shreya Shankar , a PhD researcher at Berkeley, and Justin Drake , an Ethereum Foundation researcher working on the lean Ethereum project.","Christine: Justin, can you start us off by introducing the lean Ethereum project and what that entails?","Justin: In lean Ethereum, we’re tackling verifiability in two ways. First, for deterministic blockchain computation, instead of re‐executing transactions on thousands of nodes, we use cryptographic SNARKs – short proofs a single person produces and everyone else can verify in milliseconds. Second, for the non‐deterministic consensus part, we aim to speed up voting to achieve finality in seconds instead of minutes.","Christine: Shreya, I saw you smiling when Justin mentioned SNARKs. Is that something you are interested in as it relates to verifiability?","Shreya: I smiled because I learned about zk-SNARKs early in my PhD – they’re very cool! My own work is on DocETL , a declarative system for unstructured data processing. For example, a public defender might mine court transcripts to find racially biased statements. This requires reasoning beyond traditional databases, so DocETL lets users write MapReduce-style pipelines with operators defined in natural language and executed by LLMs.","Verifiability for us means: how do we ensure AI outputs align with human expectations? We optimize pipelines for accuracy and cost, sometimes replacing LLM functions with deterministic code. We also expose statistical primitives so users can verify samples and estimate worst‐case accuracy. Provenance – establishing where in the source particular data statements came from – and understanding AI reasoning are important too.","Justin: That reminds me of my ‘spectrum of trust’ model. On one end you have math, physics, cryptography – things you trust completely. On the other, legal systems and reputation – mushy, subjective. Blockchains aim for trust minimization, pushing everything toward the ‘trustless’ end. Dispute resolution in marketplaces remains hard; maybe your work could help build trustless marketplaces without escrow agents.","Shreya: How are disputes handled now?","Justin: In OpenBazaar, buyers and sellers agree on a trusted escrow agent. It’s reputation‐based and can be ineﬀicient. Agents can also be tempted to collude for large transactions.","Christine: Shreya, talk about AI evals in verifiability.","Shreya: We annotate AI outputs to identify features correlated with human disagreement – missing definitions, odd prioritization, etc. – until the distribution of these ‘qualitative codes’ stabilizes. Then we can train LLM judges to evaluate outputs at scale and measure misalignment.","Justin: Decentralization in Ethereum is similarly hard to measure. The Nakamoto coeﬀicient – how many operators control 33% or 50% of stake – has limits. SNARKs lower barriers to entry so even small devices can verify. For non‐deterministic aspects, economic penalties ensure that bad behavior would destroy large amounts of staked value. Shreya, how are adversarial actors handled in AI?","Shreya: We see two threat models: malicious users crafting pipelines to prove biased points, and non‐malicious users blindly trusting AI outputs without knowing counterfactuals. The latter worries me more.","Justin: In SNARKs, we counter maliciousness with interactive proofs – multiple rounds where the verifier challenges the prover – and ‘hinting,’ where the prover supplies extra information to make verification easier.","Shreya: I can imagine combining those for DocETL: for example, AI showing users samples it didn’t find interesting and asking them to label them.","Justin: Hinting parallels a teacher giving students clues. Shreya: In data science, negligent or biased analysis isn’t new – but AI’s agency over vast amounts of unstructured data makes the problem more urgent.","Justin: We have recursive proof composition – combining fast but large proofs with slow but small proofs to get both speed and compactness. You could apply a recursive AI approach: one AI isolates snippets, another evaluates them.","Shreya: We do something similar, decomposing problems into units different AIs handle well, and measuring accuracy after rewrites.","Christine: Is there a tension between verifiability and eﬀiciency?","Justin: In Ethereum rollups, each flavor trades off differently: optimistic rollups have long challenge periods; zk-rollups require heavy upfront proof building; TEE rollups trust hardware; committee rollups trust members. Energy limits mean we can’t snarkify all AI – so we must be selective.","Shreya: In AI data systems, computation vs. resource cost trade‐offs are constant. DocETL partitions tasks to minimize cost and maximize accuracy – using deterministic functions for simple tasks, reserving LLMs for reasoning.","Justin: That’s like the co‐processor and glue model: specialized processors for repetitive tasks, flexible ‘glue’ for unstructured problems.","Shreya: Yes, for example filtering transcripts deterministically to discard irrelevant text before using LLMs.","Justin: In SNARKs, a team built auto pre‐compiles – machine‐generated specialized processors – which sometimes outperform human‐written ones, even for hash functions. … Blockchains would seem to provide an ideal money for AI because AIs don’t have access to bank accounts, but they can have access to cryptocurrency. When you combine that with the presumption that AIs are going to be so much smarter than we are, it’s only natural to presume that AIs are going to be the richest entities in the world and they’re going to be storing almost all of their wealth in cryptocurrencies. What kind of emotions that does that invoke in you?","Shreya: Giving AI currency could create alignment incentives we currently lack. But what happens if AIs hoard wealth? What can they spend it on? In data analysis, I’d pay more for better AI, but that could be costly.","Christine: Could you hardcode AI to value a cryptocurrency as its ultimate goal, even without things to spend it on?","Justin: Network effects could make such money valuable if other AIs accept it for tasks. I foresee a future where AIs pay humans to do things they can’t.","Shreya: True – AIs will need compute, memory, and human labor for certain tasks.","Justin: Some jurisdictions might grant AIs legal entity status, enabling bank accounts. We’ll see experiments on whether that leads to better or worse outcomes.","Christine: What are some sibling concepts to verifiability?","Justin: In blockchains, reproducibility is key: nodes re‐execute to get the same result. Bugs are mitigated either through client diversity – independent teams producing matching results – or formal verification, proving software has zero bugs. Formal verification is hard for AI, but AIs can help formalize SNARKs by tackling sub‐problems in parallel.","Shreya: In AI, reproducibility is often misunderstood. Non‐determinism isn’t bad – it’s a feature – but we may need statistical claim reproducibility rather than exact output reproducibility.","Shreya: I’m excited about hints – using them to make verification easier has clear analogs in data processing.","Justin: I’m encouraged by efforts to turn mushy realities into black‐and‐white outcomes. Maybe Shreya’s research could replace referees in sports or escrow agents in marketplaces, solving the last 20% where humans are still needed."],"tags":["Liked by Protocolized"]},{"id":89,"title":"Risky Autonomy vs. Walled Gardens","subtitle":"Issue #12: A story about tensions, EigenLayer guest talk, and sci-fi contest extension","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: Artist, researcher, and software developer Sarah Friend (SoP23) explores a tension central to the grey areas of high stakes software.

The tone was like a spaceship landing, I’m told—though it was just the default for my phone’s model, the OnePlus 12. I wonder what people thought when they heard it.

No. None of these things.","One time, I was at a performance at Gropius Bau, a large contemporary art gallery in Berlin. White walls, vaulted ceilings—definitely the kind of thing you’re supposed to have your phone on silent for.

It can happen quickly; not hours but minutes. Thus the alarm.","Being diabetic is many things—it's stressful, it’s tiring, it provokes uncomfortable existential questions. Another thing it means is that the body is intimately integrated with software. There are a variety of devices to aid the dosing of insulin and measuring of blood sugar, many software-mediated, including insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors. I have been using the latter, and it’s the device that was responsible for my pet spaceship: the 24/7 ringer that got me angry stares in the movie theatre, confused glances in the grocery store checkout line, and woke me up at midnight. The cgm streams my blood sugar data to my phone in real time. But this, my greatest tool in diabetic management, began over time to also feel like the villain in a psychological drama. It pursued me ceaselessly, watching round the clock: a sonic assailant that I could never escape because it of course was part of myself … until it wasn’t.","Browsing reddit one day after a hardware upgrade, I found a post on reddit leading me to a github repo for something called “ xDrip ”, an open source android app for reading cgm signals. I downloaded the .apk and installed it, expecting trouble. To my surprise it worked perfectly: I found a switch to disable all alarms for as long as I wanted, the ability to delete the built-in alarms entirely and add my own custom ones, triggered at whatever blood sugar levels I chose. I could add a different profile for different times of day, enabling less aggressive numbers at night (and therefore more nights of uninterrupted sleep), and even a different sound for each alarm. Just like that, I had root access to the spaceship. I knew I had been in something like a walled garden—a closed system where the possibilities had been artificially constrained. What I hadn’t realized is just how easy it would be to walk out.","Are apps like this legal? Maybe, depending on your jurisdiction. Where I live, my doctor is not allowed to recommend or even mention it, but she’s not legally obligated to stop me from using it if I choose. Is it safe? For me, it has improved health outcomes—physical and mental, but I won’t deny that for some patients it may be more dangerous. Not everyone is as comfortable with open source software as I am. And not everyone with diabetes is an adult. It’s easy to understand why a manufacturer would make the most urgent category of alarms unsilenceable. But I’ve chosen my risky autonomy, and you can take it from my cold dead hands - a phrase I don’t use only idiomatically, since my life is in fact a chip on the table.","In Chiang Mai, at Edge Lanna, fresh in my second month of open-source freedom, I started to reflect on how what I’d experienced with cgm apps spoke to a more widespread protocol tension. One day, I was walking to lunch—with some difficulty, as crossing the street in Chiang Mai is an art. In Germany, where I live, people will wait for a red crossing signal to turn green even in the dead of night on an empty road. Old ladies will scold you for jaywalking. This same behaviour in Chiang Mai will have you waiting on the same side of the road you started on, long after your hunger has faded into the clear-eyed alertness of fasting and your lunch date has given up on you and gone home.","There is a lot of traffic, and far fewer crosswalks and streetlights than you might expect. You must instead watch traffic closely and seize any opportunity you see. Besides cars, Thailand has the highest motorcycle usage in the world. Scooters and motorcycles swarm between lanes. Google Maps has adapted, offering different routes and travel times for scooters vs cars. There’s no doubt that being able to squeeze between cars can get you to your destination faster, and indeed the scooter travel estimate is often the fastest one on display, but it’s definitely a trade off that comes with some risk: Thailand notably ranks highest in motorcycle fatalities, as well. The motorcyclists have chosen risky autonomy. The drivers of cars perhaps less so. But everyone on the road in Thailand is experiencing more risky autonomy than the walled garden of German crosswalks. I contrasted both to the even stricter system of air travel that had brought me to Thailand just a few days before, with its literal security perimeter.","During one of our workshops, I presented the dichotomy of “risky autonomy” vs “walled garden”. Our group found examples everywhere: Linux vs Apple, a tradfi bank vs crypto, different political systems. Some enclosures are opt-in (e.g., Apple) others are not (traffic laws). One core thing that matters, as I think with all assessments of risky autonomy vs walled garden, is which direction the risk is pointing. Risk is not a scalar, it is a vector, which is to say it’s not experienced uniformly across a system nor does it have the same pattern in all systems. When I, an adult with no dependents, bypass official software for diabetic tech, the risk is substantially towards myself. With traffic, this is less clear and changes based on what kind of vehicle you’re driving (scooter, car, plane)—the likelihood of each of these to harm people who aren’t the driver (or pilot) is very different—and that’s likely why, in both Chiang Mai and Germany, drivers of cars experience and consent to more regulation than pedestrians.","But of course, this framing of walled garden/risky autonomy as two poles in opposition might itself be a walled garden. Is the \"dichotomy\" itself another artificial constraint? You can ask where a specific system sits between two forces, or how the choice between them is made, but the conversation really gets interesting when you start to unravel the dichotomy itself. For example, thinking about the direction of risk in a system reveals key differences between cgm app features and traffic laws. Risky autonomy and walled garden are present as forces in both systems, but there's more on the table. And in some cases, if we focus on this specific \"more\" we may be able to imagine our way out of a trade off entirely. In order to enable developer mode on Android, you have to go to Settings -> About phone and tap the Build number 7 times, like entering a magic password. This action is presumed to be so unusual that anyone undertaking it must know what they're doing, and any corresponding increase in the danger is assumed to be understood. With another open source diabetic tech project, Android APS, a new user has to use the app with a series of levels, which take a minimum duration of 28 days to be completed. When the diabetic user successfully completes all objectives, like playing through levels in a video game, they receive full access to all features. A pattern like this could go in cgm apps by default. Or if you want an appeal to authority, we can imagine an auth code that can only be input by an endocrinologist. Or a signed legal waiver. Or maybe something else. By more closely considering benefits for each type of system, we can at least start to suggest ways to resolve the tension: to move beyond picking a side, towards the optimal.","The founder and the CEO of EigenLayer , Sreeram Kannan, will join us tomorrow, April 16th, at 10:00 PDT (18:00 UTC) to talk about technical protocols, different kinds of trust, and innovation in conversation with Venkatesh Rao.

Besides naming the phenomenon, we want to offer you a set of pre-theoretical frames for thinking about it, and invite you to join us in our ongoing efforts to theorize it.","The goal of this two-part essay is to introduce the work of the Special Interest Group in Formal Protocol Theory (SIGFPT) over the last six months, and invite you to join us as we begin our second year of explorations. In this first part, we will establish some broad qualitative background and overarching frames and concepts. In Part II, to be published in a few weeks, we will introduce you to the specific theoretical apparatuses and technical attacks we are exploring, for developing formal protocol theory.","Join us on our Discord for the 2026 kickoff meeting of SIGFPT on Friday, January 9, 10am Pacific. Calendar invite for series.","So what is protocolization? In what follows, we will explore this question, with a view to setting up a canvas for formal and mathematical attempts to theorize it in general ways.","Protocolization is an unfolding long-term planetary transformation that is at least as old as modernity itself. That is to say, it is at least several centuries old, and has unfolded through multiple distinct chapters, in loose synchronization with major technological revolutions. Protocolization is the overarching story of how humanity has cashed out and orchestrated the capabilities of every wave of new technologies to make our world ever more comfortable and hospitable for humans.","One side of protocolization is arguably an ongoing terraforming. The first terraforming in fact ; that of Terra itself, preceding any science-fictional terraformings of other planets.","The other side of protocolization is changes in human behavior in response to this terraforming. Relative to our ancestors, we have become more predictable and orderly on some fronts, and more unpredictable and generative on others. Protocolization is simultaneously a civilizing process, and a rewilding process.","Protocolization is reducible neither to its technological drivers, nor to the changes in human nature triggered by them. Protocolization is the co-evolution of both into what we might call a new nature. A planetary condition powerfully determined by the l aws of the artificial , which can increasingly be engineered to be nearly as immutable and indefinitely persistent as those of nature itself.","Protocolization proper has received almost no attention, either popular or scholarly. It has merely been partially glimpsed in peripheral vision in attempts to understand more visible and dramatic planetary processes (such as modernization , industrialization , globalization , urbanization , and digitalization) , which offer readier, more legible approaches to analysis and synthesis.","These more dramatic processes typically also feature charismatic technological megafauna at their cores – printing presses, steam engines, automobiles, ocean liners, skyscrapers, bridges, superhighways, rockets, airplanes, nuclear reactors, supercomputers, AI systems, miracle medicines, robots. These “hero” technologies lend themselves to anthropomorphic projection, and encourage a view of human-technological co-evolution as a kind of augmented hero’s journey. Our default notions of “progress” are of this heroic variety.","By contrast, the technological elements of protocols – interoperability standards, kits, standardized fasteners, electrical connectors, plumbing regulations, safety codes, sewage pipes, modularity grammars – typically gently diffuse and deflect anthropomorphic impulses. Rather than serving our heroic individualist impulses, they quietly orchestrate and shape our mutualist and cooperative energies. Protocolization looks like ecological emergence rather than a technological hero’s journey. It encourages a very different narrative of progress.","We hope to convince you that “protocolization” elegantly subsumes some of the most salient features of the more dramatic and “heroic technology” process frames you might be used to, while also apprehending (if not yet quite comprehending ) a great deal that those frames remain systematically blind to.","It may help to keep a pair of pictures in mind. One is the familiar image of the African savannah, with its tableau of charismatic megafauna. The other is the near-pitch darkness of the mesopelagic zone of the oceans, beyond the reach and attention of both fishing fleets and the cameras of shark documentaries. This zone is densely populated by a family of bioluminescent fish that you may have never heard of or seen pictures of – Bristlemouths ( Gonostomatidae ) – which number in the trillions to quadrillions , constituting nearly 90% of fish biomass on the planet by some estimates. These fish anchor not just oceanic ecologies, but the entire planetary ecology.","Dramatic planetary processes are stories about the first kind of image. Protocolization on the other hand, is the story about the second kind of image.","The first kind of image requires no particular skills to see and appreciate, and anchors most visions of technological progress and change. The second kind of image is much harder to see, and takes cultivated protocol-watching skills, but is also much more useful for understanding how ecologies actually work; how new nature works.","Since our goal is to build powerful and useful theories of new nature, we navigate by the second kind of vision of technology; we try to search for formal theories and tools that can help us see, model, predict, and shape the “mesopelagic zone” aspect of new nature, rather than the “African savannah” aspect.","The most recent chapter of protocolization, triggered a half-century ago by the affordances of early computer networks, has been transforming the world in profound and accelerating ways. But arguably, it has barely been theorized at all, largely because when you try to look closely, it looks like the mesopelagic ocean depths rather than the African savannah.","For the purposes of this essay, we will loosely define protocolization as follows:","Protocolization is the progressive metabolization of reliably repeatable technologically mediated human behaviors at all scales into reliable planetary infrastructures for coordination.","Here, we mean technological mediation in a broad sense, encompassing conceptual and cultural technologies such as the decimal system (instrumental in the development of modern book-keeping) or hygiene or nutritional practices that first took shape as religious observances.","It is worth noting that though we only mention human behavior in the definition, these behaviors shape the fates of all other life on the planet as well. Not just the major domesticated species of plants and animals, but through the shaping of “wilderness” regimes of the planet, all other life as well.","Protocolization is driven by some mix of knowledge discovery and diffusion, technology enablement , and human behavior change, resulting in a slow accumulation of new nature ecologies across the planet.","An example we use frequently in SIGFPT meetings is hand-washing.","The global ubiquity of hand-washing protocols was driven by the discovery and diffusion of knowledge about infectious diseases, coupled with ubiquitous technological infrastructure that has made clean water and soap available everywhere in modern built environments. The protocolization of hand-washing behaviors transformed a planetary landscape of previously uncoordinated and high-variance local cultural practices into an infrastructural behavior with much lower variance. As a direct result , public health improved everywhere. The planet became more comfortable and hospitable for humanity.","Thousands of similar examples can be listed across every area of human behavior, and in every corner of the built environment, at all scales from individual to international, and from trash cans to continental supergrids.","An entertaining cross-section view of protocolization can be found simply by listening for the word protocol in movies and television. Such usage has exploded in the last half-century. One of our favorite specific illustrations comes from long-running television franchises. In Star Trek for example , the word protocol was not used at all in the original series, but is used hundreds of times in more recent shows within the franchise.","This already extant cultural footprint, by the way, is why we expect you to find the term protocolization intuitive, and experience an immediate sense of recognition of what we’re pointing to with the term, even if you’ve never stopped to think about it before.","Domains like climate, traffic, networked computing, and healthcare make particular (and domain-specific) use of protocol-based understandings of the human and machine behaviors they design and translate into infrastructures. In other domains, protocols might not be the direct result of conscious design, but manifest as unexpected systematicity, orderliness, and serendipity in how things happen, which goes unnoticed and un-theorized.","But we do sometimes notice – when we travel to a city or country with more reliable subway services than our own, for example, we are struck by a sense of serendipity suffusing our transit experiences; a sense that the world is unusually hospitable in ways precisely attuned to our needs.","That is protocolization; steadily accumulating ecological transformations of the planet, each of which makes us feel surprisingly, magically lucky when we first encounter them, but which rapidly turn into tuned-out backgrounds and unconscious expectations of artificial lawfulness in our environmental contexts.","Even though protocolization has been as momentous as more dramatic planetary transformations like computerization and globalization, as well as earlier ones such as urbanization, consumerization, and industrialization, it remains hidden.","This is because, by their very nature, protocols in their evolved forms tend towards invisibility, and protocolization as the evolutionary process that creates them seeks out invisibility. This feature, arguably, is central to how and why protocolization constitutes progress. Protocolization is progress through invisibility .","Here, we mean invisibility in a broad, multi-dimensional and textured sense, beyond merely literal visual invisibility. The invisibility of protocols has multiple aspects:","Operational invisibility – We don’t think about the protocol while using it, acting through muscle memory.","Infrastructural invisibility – The machinery is literally hidden/backgrounded, like the ecologically critical mesopelagic zones we alluded to earlier. For example, cables and sewage lines are buried, and are generally as ubiquitous and invisible as bristlemouth fish.","Social/cognitive invisibility – People don’t recognize protocolization is happening because by definition, behavioral habituation is not only part of the essence of the process, it is functionally load-bearing. Traffic protocols would be much less effective if we were constantly aware of them. We “stay in our lanes,” without thinking about it, and reflexively signal turns and stop at stop signs.","Anti-memetic qualities – Protocols rarely feature in headlines, titles, or public discourse, because the unremarkable “boring” quality, with one experience being largely indistinguishable from another, is essential to their functioning.","Marginality – Protocols often organize and scaffold the technological space around other, more charismatic technologies that are intrinsically more visible, and more directly support foreground goals. They perform prophylactic functions, enforce constraints, and structure core behaviors for coordination and synchronization. For instance, the safety protocols of airline travel – airport security checks, seatbelts – are on the margins of the foreground retail experience of air travel. We do not think much about them when making travel plans.","Default quietness – Protocols are quiet and unobtrusive by default, and make themselves visible primarily when they fail. An ordinary hand-washing episode is not memorable among the tens of thousands that happen over an individual lifetime. An episode involving an empty soap-dispenser or malfunctioning faucet is memorable.","Obliquity of action – Protocols rarely directly act on consciously controlled human behaviors in pursuit of explicitly held intentions or goals. Rather, they act through secondary pathways of supporting causation, contingency triggers, and automated follow-through. For every conscious action in a technologically advanced environment, dozens of supporting actions may unfold unnoticed, rendering the conscious behavior preternaturally frictionless and seemingly “free.” The scope of protocolization is often everything else that must happen in order for actions you consciously and freely intend and do to succeed.","Aspects of protocols are of course highly visible in specific contexts. For example, everyone knows what USB is at a lay level, and what is meant by “containerization.” Standards bodies debate specs publicly (though it is worth noting that such debates are rarely newsworthy unless they fail in dramatic ways). But we hardly ever think about the USB protocol, even as we routinely plug and unplug connectors several times everyday. Or about the mechanics of containerization driving the endless torrent of package deliveries at our doorsteps.","So to a first approximation, and across multiple domains, protocols are invisible technological phenomenology . They could be considered technological dark matter; evading study by retreating to the margins of our attention, ceding the spotlight to the “main characters” of the technological environment – striking buildings, beautiful bridges, impressive airplanes and rockets, awe-inspiring AI systems.","Protocol designers in nearly every field rightly view such invisibility as a feature rather than a bug. Protocol designers intuitively tend to design for invisibility. Invisibility of some sort – from literal visual invisibility to the reflexive automaticity in our own responses to subconsciously registered cues – is either a strong functional requirement, or at least highly desirable. Often, the very reliability of a protocol rests on its invisibility, and visibility can lead to fragility and unreliability.","Keep a protocol in peripheral vision, and it works. Look too directly at it, or attend to your behaviors within it too deliberately, and it starts to falter.","Within our young field, it is now a convention to refer to a valuable advance in protocolization, marked by a transition of an important behavior to invisibility and collective unconsciousness, as a “Whitehead advance.”","Protocolization can be understood as a centuries-old macro-trend of progress through invisibility, but this progress does not come for free. There is a clear cost associated with it, in the form of a new class of problems induced by invisibility.","This is most apparent in governance at larger social scales. In the most extraordinary cases, such as the effect of vaccines (inarguably one of the greatest Whitehead advances), protocolization becomes invisible to the point of even erasing its own historical raison d’être , and undermining the broader literacies required to sustain itself. We might perhaps call this pathology overprotocolization .","Modern vaccine denialism is possible precisely because vaccination protocols have made their own logic largely invisible through their extraordinary success. Something similar can be said of nuclear non-proliferation – the perception of risks of nuclear-armed conflict have diminished in proportion to the success of nuclear weapons protocols, and the attendant retreat of nuclear weapons into background invisibility.","Invisibility also creates peculiar difficulties in the study of protocols, since we are forced to talk of them through the fragmentary and mutually inconsistent languages of other fields, making the search for universal principles and general theories particularly difficult.","This, however, is a problem that we can begin to address in many ways. And one of the best ways to make protocols visible in positive ways, at least to scholarly and professional scrutiny, is to develop expressive formalisms and mathematical models to undergird a language for talking about them in general terms.","The work of SIGFPT encompasses both formalization as such (the development of ontologies and precise terminology that allow us to talk consistently about phenomenology across many domains) and mathematization (the development of suitable technical methods to investigate the phenomenology through the formalism).","Our explorations and activities should interest researchers and practitioners across a wide variety of existing fields – computer science, control theory, operations research, economics, sociology, anthropology, and political science among them.","Regardless of what background you are coming from, the value of FPT for you is mitigation of the theoretical fragmentation that you likely encounter whenever your interests lead you to protocols and protocolization.","Protocolization is a multi-scale planetary phenomenon that couples the local to the global , and entangles micro-level dynamics and macro-level dynamics, via technological media. This broad footprint across spatiotemporal scales and regimes of dynamics, exacerbated by general invisibility, tends to create fragmented theorization of hugely important phenomena.","An example will illustrate what we mean here, and motivate the approaches we are developing to mitigate theoretical fragmentation and construct more integrated understandings.","Containerization , the protocolization of global commerce, is generally analyzed through the lens of globalization , understood as a primarily political and economic phenomenon, even though it obviously involves a great deal more. At the micro-scale it is simply a mature standards process that stewards definitions of a set of relatively low-tech box form-factors. At the macro-scale it is an emergent intermodal network-of-networks for materials transport. At the local level, it is a tangle of logistics problems, such as regional staging, port operations, last-mile operations, border transit operations, and security procedures. At the global level, it is a climate-like hyperobject comprising a constantly shifting set of flows and stocks, and featuring weather-like phenomena.","To enable theoretical study of containerization, a sufficiently expressive formalism (or more likely, a harmonized assemblage of such formalisms) for protocols must be able to articulate concepts and propositions ranging from the “box” level to “planetary climate” level. It must comprehend dynamics ranging from an earthquake affecting a particular port, to a slow accumulation of empty containers on one continent due to unbalanced trade (the backhaul problem).","And this is merely the simplest sort of protocolization, where we can name and point to a relatively coherent single “protocol,” with relatively intelligible structural and behavioral phenomenology to roughly isolate, model, and study.","Such intelligibility, however, is an illusion. Any fragile, non-fragmentary picture we might build of a phenomenon like “containerization” shatters the moment we situate it in the real world, and bring it into contact with other protocols of comparable richness that occupy some of the same spaces it does.","Even within the seemingly isolatable domain of containerization, formal protocol theory faces tough tradeoffs between generality and specificity, resolution and scope, and so forth.","But the need for formal protocol theory becomes even clearer when we attempt to investigate multiple protocol infrastructures at once, motivated by provocative similarities, seductive resonances, and most importantly, consequential real-world convergences (such as many physical networks sharing right-of-way corridors).","When many protocols co-evolve in convergent ways and get materially entangled, constituting a single protocolization process spanning multiple partially visible and operationally coupled infrastructures, they tend to become especially invisible. This is because a view corresponding to one component protocol and associated set of interests misses all the others.","Since the early days of protocol studies, we have thought of this as the “three blind men and an elephant” problem in studying protocols, especially large and complex ones.","Such circumstances present as especially acute fragmentation of attempts to study them theoretically. We refer to such circumstances as protocol tangles. Here are some examples:","Factory automation emerged at the intersection of computerization within factories, and globalization between (globally distributed) factories. It is a tangle that cannot be adequately studied by any of the obviously relevant disciplines, such as industrial engineering, operations research, computer science, economics, or trade policy.","Global public health regimes , a response to planetary-scale contagion phenomena, are tangles comprising protocols at the intersection of municipal public health infrastructures, global pharmaceutical research and disease surveillance protocols, and international relations.","The presently unraveling Rules-Based Order of international relations is a tangle of planetary scale coordination problems factored into impoverished sets of nation-centric problems. Even though massive international cooperation undertakings (such as the UN Food Program, the UNHCR, and the WWF), operate as exceptionally invisible protocol infrastructures, they are understood and governed through highly impoverished and fragmented theoretical frames.","The worst protocol tangles are so invisible, they even lack names with which to point to them. Attempts to think systematically about them run aground immediately at the level of language.","For example, we lack even a name for the particular protocol tangle comprising containerization infrastructure, the internet infrastructure used to govern it, and the multinational corporations that manage the entanglement. We are reduced to thinking in terms of sui generis historical episodes, such as the “2017 Maersk ransomware attack,” rather than powerful theoretical frames attached to particular units of analysis, and usefully general operating principles.","In this instance, despite the similarity of the two networks (both are packet-switched networks of sorts), it is awkward to talk about the converged tangle in the language of either containerization or the internet. For example, a key difference between the core protocols of the two networks is that internet packets can be “dropped” and re-transmitted but lost containers cannot trivially be “re-shipped.” Another is that the container network has a “backhaul” problem, but the internet does not.","How does one theorize the implications of these differences to shed light on a shared phenomenon like “buffer bloat”? Could we talk formally of reversibly vs. irreversibly lossy protocols? How does one use such theorizing to deal with problems where the two networks converge or collide in the real world, such as in the case of the Maersk ransomware attack? Could we invent a converged “internet of containers” that is robust to such attacks?","So while both might be considered part of a broader class of packet-switched networks, it is not immediately obvious how to construct a formal theory encompassing both that is not uselessly over-general (like the famed “spherical cow” problem), and useful in engineering application.","As a result, discourse on the beguiling similarities between these two protocol infrastructures tend to remain in the realm of poetry and metaphor. Consequential encounters between the two, like the Maersk attack, never gravitate out of history books and into engineering or management textbooks.","Where the impoverishment caused by fragmented and incompatible frames becomes too severe, as in the case of climate action, planetary AI, and blockchains, coordination fails almost entirely, and the failure of sufficiently ambitious and powerful theorization is most acutely felt.","So as protocols become ever more complex, ever more mutually entangled, and non-reducible to non-protocol infrastructures or technological islands, they become increasingly difficult to deal with and govern.","And perhaps no protocol tangle is more devilishly difficult to comprehend and investigate than the planet-scale one caused in the last half-century by computation.","In developing formalisms and mathematical approaches, it is worth paying special attention to a particularly consequential tangle of protocols , involving the varied modern interacting infrastructures that rest on computing capabilities. This tangle includes, but is not limited to: the existing internet, AI, blockchains, AR/VR, robotics, the “internet of things,” and planetary sensing/monitoring infrastructures, at all scales from microscopic to orbital.","This is the civilizational-level boss of protocol tangles, the planetary computational tangle, or PCT.","As the Maersk ransomware attack episode showed, it is already clear that the default mental model of the PCT as some sort of “extended internet” has been severely strained, to the point of collapse. While pleasing new formulations like “planetary intelligence” help us at least point to the PCT, they typically pre-commit to an overly legible and panoramic theorization heavily shaped by a unitary perspective, aesthetic leanings, and focal interests shaped by their most charismatic elements. They miss the essential messy plurality of the PCT, and the inextricability of human experiences and agencies within it. They serve our appreciative needs, but not the instrumental needs of practically useful theorization.","To develop powerful mental models of the PCT, especially given that thinking of the internet itself as merely a “network of computers” has already proved to be highly limiting, we need a radically different approach to theorizing. One that privileges a worm’s-eye view of the tangled messiness over pleasing panoramic views and grand narratives.","For formal protocol theory, the PCT might be viewed as the “one ring” modeling and governance challenge.","To the extent we are able to build theories and practical techniques for grappling with it, we will be able to make sense of all dimensions of protocolization, and deal more elegantly with more bite-sized protocol problems that can be meaningfully isolated and tackled. It is already clear that existing ontologies will not do when it comes to “carving the reality of the PCT at the joints,” so to speak, to isolate problems worth tackling. New ontologies are required.","To the extent we fail, our increasingly technologically terraformed planet will become invisible not just to our senses, but also to our minds.","The irruption of AI into the world, currently the most dramatic and attention-attracting world process, is worth some additional thought. Currently, the role of AI in the PCT is being understood and constructed through the lenses of corporate product development and nation-state-based “sovereign AI” frames. This approach is inherited from previous experiences like dealing with fissile materials or climate change. These frames miss much of what is important, interesting, valuable, and risky about AI, especially when dealing with its rising “agentic” usage at planetary-infrastructure scales. Such usage is unlikely to remain limited to the traditional boundaries and capabilities of products, corporations, or nations, and human actors who identify with them.","Similarly, the role of blockchain-based infrastructures in the PCT is being reduced to rigid and relatively unimaginative nation-based identity and monetary infrastructures. This again misses much of what is important, interesting, valuable, and risky about them. The flexible programmability of infrastructures like the Ethereum “world computer,” with its capacity for expressing and articulating novel and fluid regimes of law and governance, and disciplining the myriad wildernesses of the PCT with striations of orderly hardness, remains largely unexplored. Again in part due to the limiting theoretical frames through which it is viewed.","Our mental models of the PCT are perhaps most severely compromised when it comes to the raw materiality of it.","There are already over 17 billion connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the world. We are currently on the cusp of a robotics boom. Planet-scale sensor-networks and environmental monitoring systems are beginning to take shape all around us. Warfare has already been irreversibly transformed by autonomous vehicles on air, sea, and land, and civilian life is poised to follow.","The picture is similar at the micro-scale as well. From home automation and self-driving cars, to robots on sidewalks, we are drowning in a chaotic sea of “globally local” small-scale protocols everywhere. Conventional frames, such as traditional urbanism for sidewalk governance, or home construction practices that clumsily attempt to integrate ideas like “smart keys” for package delivery and “smart thermostats” for energy management, struggle to rein in the chaos. The result is proliferating localized Darwinian “technological tangled banks” of hyperlocal infrastructure ecologies that are invisibly connected to the planetary-scale PCT.","Even apparently small, simple, and isolatable examples of protocols, such as hand-washing, become complex to theorize when they are embedded into the PCT.","What happens to handwashing, for instance, when all soap dispensers turn into small internet-connected robots that can order refills for themselves online? What changes in our behaviors when smart faucets start singing happy birthday at us to ensure we spend the mandated twenty seconds washing our hands in controlled environments?","Mathematization and formalization have not always been part of human governance responses to major planetary transformations. Computerization was partially theorized early and powerfully, through the development of frameworks such as Turing machines and the lambda calculus. Globalization was accompanied by the rise of fields like operations research and supply chain management that formalized and mathematized critical aspects of it.","Economics, a field that offers many precedents, cues and clues for Protocol Studies, mathematized in fits and starts in the process growing beyond mere description and analysis to become the operating system of the global economy (as Donald Mackenzie powerfully argued in his classic, An Engine, Not a Camera ). Along the way, thanks to the methodological demands of economics, rigorous and formal statistical sciences emerged from unsystematic beginnings in gamblers’ intuitions and superstitions.","But other planetary transformation forces have resisted formalization and mathematization. Protocolization lies somewhere between phenomena like computerization and financialization on the one hand, which lend themselves very well to formalization, and phenomena like urbanization and consumerization on the other, which resist paradigmatic treatments more cohesive than ethnographic and sociological analysis.","Some mathematization and formalization is clearly possible, especially because so much of the substance of protocolization is technological. But trying to formalize too much is misguided.","In the second part of this essay we will lay out the particular approach the SIGFPT is taking to this challenge.","Formal Protocol Theory (FPT) is one of a handful of disciplinary areas within the broader emerging field of Protocol Studies, and in our activities and explorations, we maintain collegial ongoing dialogues with several peer areas, devoted to shared concerns and intellectual foundations.","The current list of areas, and associated Special Interest Groups, can be found here , along with participation information. Below, we briefly describe these adjacent areas in relation to FPT (each meets once every other week).","The Memory Research Group (MRG), led by Kei Kreutler , studies the role of memory in protocols, protocol technologies, and protocolization processes.","Perhaps one of the major contributing factors to the invisibility of protocols is their close relationship to memory and forgetting. The most successful protocols don’t involve user manuals during their operation, but produce and propagate the necessary, operable memory through their performance. In the spirit of the “medium is the message,” we might say that “the protocol is the memory.” For example, blockchains produce a record of their actions as part of their actions themselves, and this record is actually one of their primary utilities. The contemporary era of protocolization is marked by the ever-closer coincidence of procedures and their memory traces.","The MRG studies memory in all its manifestations, and in 2026, SIGFPT will take cues from MRG to look for ways in which we might formalize and theorize the memory features of protocols.","The Special Interest Group in Protocols for Business (SIGP4B), led by rafa , studies protocols within organizations, approaching the domains of existing fields like management science, organizational behavior, and organizational psychology, through the lens of protocol theory.","Specialized organizations and sectors that fulfill various societal functions have historically been the locus of a great deal of protocol development and evolution. Technological specialization is another major contributing factor to the invisibility of protocols. Not only are many protocol infrastructures hidden behind the boundaries of organizations devoted to developing and using them, knowledge of such protocols is also hidden behind sector-specific jargon. Even protocols that enjoy a degree of universal presence across sectors and industries and some lay familiarity – such as those involved in managing supply chains, or staff functions such as human resources and facilities management – tend to become invisible behind the boundaries of functional specialization.","Currently SIGP4B is undertaking a protocol-theoretic exploration of perhaps the most important organizational technology in a century: AI. Effective adoption and use of AI technologies is a protocolization problem that is being simultaneously tackled by all organizations across the world in near-crisis mode. There is much to see and learn.","In 2026, SIGFPT will take cues from SIGP4B to help theorize the injection of AI into traditional organizational environments.","Building on a year of publishing dozens of protocol fiction stories here on Protocolized, the Protocol Fiction SIG, led by Spencer Nitkey - Writer and Sachin , studies the rules and principles of this emerging genre, and explores how to look at our protocolizing world more effectively through stories.","For us in SIGFPT, we hope to find both stimulation and entertainment in the work of this SIG, as well as inspiration and motivation. Fiction can often point to subtle phenomena and generative contradictions and paradoxes that can power theoretical investigations. The notion of “protocol tangles” developed in this essay, for example, was largely inspired by the many tangled plots and premises that have been explored through protocol fiction in the last year.","Besides these three peer SIGs, other SIGs may be spun up this year.","In the second part of this essay we will dive deeper into our early ideas. In the meantime, if you’re interested in participating in SIGFPT, you may want to read these older updates based on our work in 2025.","What is Formal Protocol Theory","Constructing the Evil Twin of AI","We hope to see you this Friday for our 2026 kickoff.","Join us on our Discord for the 2026 kickoff meeting of SIGFPT on Friday, January 9, 10am Pacific.

Unfortunately, she decides to investigate.","At 04:13, the city rerouted Sector 14-B.","No sirens sounded. No alerts were issued. A subtle adjustment to transit logic, some traffic-light prioritization, a silent update to routing preferences across the public System. Delivery drones updated their no-fly corridors. Smart waste units bypassed their usual collection points. Ride-hail algorithms stopped suggesting pickups in that region. The sidewalk lighting dimmed by eleven percent.","Within ninety seconds, the sector was classified as temporarily non-essential .","By dawn, it might as well have never existed.","Mira Jalil didn’t notice any of that.","During her morning run, Mira's HUD charted a meticulous path through the urban tapestry—a route that wove through the lush vertical gardens clinging to the towering steel facades, like nature's quiet rebellion against the Grid. The city exuded a rhythm of calculated energy, its augmented projections flickering softly over busy intersections. But today, the overlay faltered—just one quiet glitch—a brief disruption in the usual seamless digital symphony, before recalibrating, leaving a lingering note of unease.","She slowed, scanned the horizon. A side street—unlit, unmarked—sat to her left. And people. Six or seven. Still. Watching. Not part of the augmented world.","She blinked. Emptiness. They were gone. The display normalized. The city reabsorbed the glitch.","Shaking her head, she kept running.","Mira recalled her CivicOps training days—a memory of her mentor, Mr. Elgin, standing in front of an emblem of the city's motto: \"Efficiency for All.\"","The mantra resonated deeply with her. She remembered his words vividly: \"Our work ensures that every citizen's needs are met. We are the stewards of balance.\"","Behind her, the street dimmed further.","Mira arrived at CivicOps just before 07:00. The atrium glowed with diffused blue light, every surface embedded with responsive material. The walls displayed a softly pulsing network map of the city—public sentiment in warm pinks, energy loads in icy greens.","She moved through a checkpoint that scanned her ID, stress level, and social vector alignment, all seamlessly folded into a single gesture. As always, the result glowed green: Clear .","Mira slid into her desk, a cocoon of softly pulsating panels and dynamic displays tailored to her personal preferences. The silence around her was almost deafening in its efficiency, a void that pressed on her thoughts. She sub-vocally activated a playlist through her earpiece, choosing some soothing ambient sounds, and began to review the overnight fault queue.","Most of the items were low-level sensor misfires, data de-syncs, routine hiccups in a city that never slept. A sector-wide daylight sensor anomaly causing streetlights to activate at midday. An unexpected spike in noise levels in sub-sector 9G disrupting the automated quiet hours. Subway Line 4A registered zero ridership for three consecutive cycles.","That one was strange. CCTV snapshots embedded in the diagnostics clearly showed people boarding.","She tagged the anomaly and started compiling a System audit. The reply came back almost instantly:","CLASS: Predictive Rebalance in Effect","Her screen blinked. The report vanished.","That had never happened before.","She sat back and stared at the space on the display where the data had been. For a moment, she questioned whether she had seen it at all.","But it bothered her for the rest of the day.","That night, Mira stayed late under the pretense of cataloging archive logs. She pulled up legacy city infrastructure maps—ones stored locally, not routed through CivicOps System. The maps were sluggish to load, a testament to their neglect.","Overlaying these maps with current transit data, she noticed something startling: entire corridors, housing blocks, and utility sectors marked as \"Non-Essential / Reroute Suggested\" .","She overlaid current transit heat maps. The flagged zones were now black holes. No routes. No deliveries. No pings. A digital silence so complete it hummed in her ears.","Curious, Mira compared this with old citizen registries from five years ago. Those areas were once vibrant, home to hundreds. Now, there was no trace—names and records had vanished.","Mira checked one address twice. It had belonged to someone she once knew—a man who worked in energy diagnostics. He’d gone off-grid, or so she'd thought.","It wasn’t just about optimizing subway lines; the city seemed to be discreetly stripping away what it deemed unnecessary.","She printed out the overlays and tucked them into a sleeve, bypassing the digital signature log.","She walked into Sector 14-B at 03:42, before System activity spiked. Her HUD flickered as she crossed the boundary. Location services failed. Her map froze.","It wasn’t desolate—it was paused. Streetlamps hung dark. Autonomous service units sat idle like forgotten toys. A faint breeze carried dust and the scent of reclaimed battery acid. Mira moved with caution, each footstep echoing louder than it should.","There were signs of life. Power cords snaked through alleys, rigged into junction boxes. Makeshift lanterns flickered in windows. Someone had scrawled a map on a wall with grease pencil—an improvised grid of safe paths, water lines, signal gaps. Mira followed it.","She began to see people stirring in the shadows—living in makeshift enclosures, cooking over reclaimed induction plates powered by salvaged Grid nodes. The architecture here was part infrastructure, part improvisation. Solar cloths stretched between buildings. Mesh nets filtered rainwater. It was a city within the city, an off-script continuation.","She passed a woman tending a vertical planter rigged from old refrigeration tubing. A teenager on a rooftop watched her through a cracked visor, expression unreadable.","Eventually, Mira reached what looked like a relay shed—disused infrastructure, half-sunken into the ground. The door wasn’t locked.","As Mira stepped into the dimly lit structure, she found a figure crouched over an assortment of cobbled-together tech. An old monitor flickered softly, and wires snaked across a makeshift workbench.","Her eyes adjusted to the darkness, able to make out more detail in the figure. He was a wiry man in his early forties, with sharp eyes and a perpetual five o’clock shadow. His clothes were a patchwork of faded workwear, with pockets bulging with tools and spare parts.","\"You're not from here,\" he said without looking up, his hands deftly tuning a salvaged circuit board.","Mira didn’t answer. She watched as Callum connected the board to a series of glowing LED arrays that began to pulse in a steady rhythm.","He finally turned to face her, a sardonic smile playing on his lips. \"Didn’t think so. You still smell like the Grid,\" he said, with a voice that carried a hint of challenge and amusement.","\"Who are you?\" she asked.","\"Callum Shaw,\" he said, simply. He didn’t offer a hand. \"You’re early. I figured someone would come eventually. I just thought it’d be a drone.\"","Curiosity piqued, Mira asked, \"What are you doing?\"","Callum gestured to his setup, explaining, \"Reimagining old tech. Giving discarded things purpose again. That's liberation.\"","He looked back at her, eyes sharp, as if weighing his next words. \"The city talks efficiency. But life thrives in the cracks.\"","\"You worked for CivicOps,\" she said. It wasn’t a question.","\"A long time ago. Before I crossed a line that didn’t look like a line.\"","\"Asking what happens to people who don’t matter enough to count.\"","She stepped further in, letting the door click shut behind her, curiosity painted on her face.","Callum looked at her with a sour expression.","\"Yeah. I’m statistically irrelevant. Like the rest of us.\"","\"Stick with me,\" he said with a mischievous glint, as he led Mira down the dark side street toward a row of derelict buildings. \"See those streetlights?\" he asked, nodding toward lamps emitting a soft glow. \"Solar panels salvaged from an old array the city discarded. They're keeping this block illuminated and safe.\"","Mira glanced at the buildings, noting flickers of life inside—the glow of lanterns cobbled together from spare parts, soft music playing from an old-world record player. The scene was both surreal and remarkably alive.","Mira frowned. \"This isn't just survival. You've built a parallel system.\"","He nodded. \"The Grid relies on centralization. But there's freedom in diversification, decentralization. Out here, we learn resilience. We create our own safety nets.","Build our own connections.\" His words carried weight.","\"Efficiency is more than just a metric. It's survival. Community. You don't learn that in CivicOps.\"","Mira's perspective shifted, seeing not only Callum’s ingenuity but the thriving network he'd fostered. She began to understand his frustration with the city.","The relay shed hummed with analog life—fans wheezing gently, strips of yellowed thermal tape curling at the edges of long-forgotten labels. Mira sat hunched over a service console that should have been decommissioned a decade ago. The UI was stripped to barebones: monochrome lines, sharp grid structure, no voice, no guidance. Just commands.","Callum leaned against a rusted conduit rack nearby, arms crossed. He hadn’t spoken in ten minutes. Mira had stopped noticing.","The protocol she’d uncovered was labeled simply: VISCAP002.3 — Civic Visibility Management. No attached warnings. No alert tones. Just a small footnote:","“Deprecation status: pending. System processes active.\"","The UI accepted her credentials. No challenge. No resistance. That fact alone made her stomach churn.","“What is this?” she asked, voice quiet.","Callum stirred. “The visibility ceiling. Old civic load-balancer. We designed it when we thought attention was like water. Too much pressure and you blow out the pipes.”","Mira kept scrolling. Visibility Scores , Exchange Sets , Perception Queues —all structured like any other civic utility. Like power. Or traffic.","She loaded Sector 14-B’s reindexing potential. A line of code compiled.","Forecast: reactivation viable within load budget.","Exchange required: 3 visibility nodes.","Prepare visibility set for trade.","A branching tree of options bloomed in front of her—dozens of districts, color-coded by projected civic impact. It looked like a resource allocation dashboard. It was a resource allocation dashboard.","“You’re telling me,” she said, slowly, “that seeing has a cost?”","Callum didn’t reply right away. He picked at the edge of an old data port, as if that were easier than meeting her eyes.","“No one wants to believe it,” he said. “But yeah. Collective awareness is finite. Too much load, and the System starts dropping frames. It was supposed to be temporary. Then they automated the balancing, and it became… standard.”","Mira tapped the prompt again. A new set of three districts populated the proposed exchange—one a pediatric clinic node, another a cultural archive, the third a residential block tagged “low engagement.”","Her mouth felt dry. “These are real people.”","Callum nodded. “Somewhere, someone made the math work. Doesn’t mean it’s moral. Just stable.”","She canceled the prompt. Ran it again. New districts, new consequences. Another simulation. Another set. Each time she hoped the System would blink. Offer a fourth option. An out.","Behind her, Callum finally spoke again.","“You keep asking the same question. The System’s answered. The only variable left is whether you’re willing to let someone else pay the price.”","Mira didn’t respond. Her eyes were fixed on the blinking prompt:","She hovered her hand over the keyboard. Then withdrew it.","And ran the simulation again.","The console whined softly as Mira initiated the simulation again. She was careful this time—she toggled a manual constraint, limiting maximum civic impact to under 0.2%. The System responded in seconds, parsing an impossibly dense web of relational metrics.","Exchange viable. Cost: reduced perceptual fidelity in Zones 3F, 9A, and 7C.","She stared at the zones. 7C flagged red. Her parents lived there—still, she thought. The last time she called them had been during audit season. Two months? Three?","She backed out. Tried again with different constraints. Prioritized medical infrastructure. Minimized educational impact. Weighted by social isolation metrics.","Every permutation ended the same way. Someone lost visibility so someone else could be seen. She was trying to solve an equation with no zero.","Optimization path unavailable without offset.","“You’ve been at this for hours,” he said.","Mira kept her eyes on the screen. “The numbers change. It doesn't add up.”","“You keep asking the same question different ways, hoping the answer feels better.”","She looked back at him. His face was lit faintly by a diagnostic display—a harsh upcast light that made him look older, wearier.","“Have you done it?” she asked. “Actually executed one?”","He didn’t answer at first. Then: “Yes.”","Callum gestured toward the edge of the room, where a photo—framed under dusty glass—sat propped against an unplugged terminal. Two girls, one older than the other. The younger one wore a school uniform.","“My sister lived in Sector 12-K,” he said. “They were on the sunset list—low engagement, declining yield, risk-neutral. I forced them back into the visible layer. Thought I was saving them.”","He walked over, picked up the photo, dusted it with his sleeve.","“It worked. For a week. Then she stopped replying to messages. No error, no bounce. Just silence. I pulled logs—our address wasn’t flagged for suppression, but her entire unit had been reclassified. Not removed. Just… hidden. From search. From routing. From memory.”","He placed the frame gently back on the console.","“I didn’t even realize she was gone until I tried to send her a birthday card.”","Mira said nothing. The screens around her glowed softly, waiting.","Callum turned back toward her.","“You thought you had a choice,” he said. “But the System been watching your logic since your first click. Modeling it.”","A faint coldness gripped the back of her neck.","“It doesn’t punish you. It doesn’t need to. It just routes around you.”","Mira didn’t sleep. She barely moved.","Hours passed, then more. Callum had long since stopped offering commentary. He sat quietly in a corner, eating from a heat-warmed packet of noodles, watching her unravel without interfering.","The relay console blinked on and off, patient as stone. Each time she ran the simulation, it responded instantly:","Load impact: within acceptable deviation.","Sometimes it was her parents’ sector in the cost set. Sometimes it was a childcare node, or a religious archive, or an elder-care clinic. No matter how she weighted the variables—by population density, by community interconnectivity, by socio-emotional relevance—there was always a cost.","Visibility is a finite civic asset. Redistribution required.","Please confirm exchange to proceed.","She tabbed through models. Built her own filters. Adjusted the index tolerance from 0.5% to 0.01%. Rejected any solution with more than one standard deviation of projected distress.","The screen stuttered briefly under the weight of her demands. Then: No viable exchange found.","Each time the interface logged her attempt.","User latency exceeded expected range.","She caught the new line in the corner of the terminal window. A soft yellow alert:","Subject flagged for recursive moral processing.","The interface wasn’t just running calculations—it was watching her , too. Measuring not just outcomes, but her indecision, her looping behavior, her unwillingness to accept the protocol’s structure.","She was no longer an analyst trying to understand the System.","She was a civic inefficiency.","She leaned back from the console and let the dim glow wash over her face.","Behind her, Callum’s voice was quiet.","She shook her head, eyes unfocused. “I wasn’t trying to be a hero. Just...not make it worse.”","Mira looked back at the screen. The confirmation prompt still blinked.","She tapped the escape key.","The System didn’t freeze—it just stopped responding to her input. The prompt flickered once, then faded. Replaced by a soft, neutral message.","Her legs moved out of instinct more than discipline, feet pounding the pavement in a cadence that had once felt like control, the familiar metrics in her vision absent. Her HUD displayed nothing—no route, no metrics, no pulse check—but the rhythm was still in her body. The act of running had always been her form of certainty. A closed loop. A thing she could measure.","But now it was friction.","The sidewalks didn’t light ahead of her. The intersections didn’t sync. Doors took half a second longer to open, and autonomous vehicles paused just a bit too late to acknowledge her presence. The city wasn’t hostile. It simply… hesitated.","And Mira understood. She had become a liminal artifact —a user profile left active too long after the process had ended.","By the time she reached the old sector boundary, she was walking.","Her breath was shallow. Her spine curled forward. There was no path left to optimize.","The buildings around her stood still in the pale light, their smart surfaces flickering low-resolution errors. A trash drone bumped repeatedly into a shuttered kiosk, as if looking for instructions that never came.","She stepped across the line into the Grey Layer.","No lights guided her. No overlays warned her. The city had nothing to say.","Callum was waiting beneath a defunct relay node, arms crossed, back against the wall like a man waiting for a tide that had already come and gone.","He didn’t speak. He didn’t move.","He just looked at her and nodded.","Behind them, as the last of the augmented world fell silent, a low, unseen process logged its final assessment.","A structured account of the story’s co-creation process, organized into phases and roles.","Role: Story lead and concept miner (user), lateral explorer and generative sparring partner (assistant)","Prompt: “Select a protocol-adjacent technical concept and explore its implications through a short story with a twist.”","Role: Story architect (user), structural collaborator and systems logic enforcer (assistant)","Developed a six-part outline balancing speculative conceit and human arc","Assistant proposed multiple conceptual forks:","User selected Visibility Tradeoff as the core mechanic, with Fault Cascade embedded subtly as a thematic undertone","Refined the outline to work within a ~3,000-word constraint","Role: World interpreter (user), behavioral sculptor (assistant)","User defined Mira’s internal tensions; assistant supplied narrative function and dialogue cadences","Mira’s characterization evolved around discipline, doubt, and deferred defiance","Role: Tone director (user), consistency steward (assistant)","User requested tighter emotional mirroring and less contrivance in the Mira/Callum meeting","Dialogue and system voice reworked for controlled neutrality with surgical interjections of dread","Ending anchored to early motifs (efficiency, running, light dimming)","Role: Narrative driver (user), prose engine and pacing calibrator (assistant)","Assistant generated each scene sequentially based on outline","User directed rhythm, inner voice, and key metaphors","Mira’s moral loop (“she became the inefficiency”) clarified and tightened by user feedback","User reinforced narrative symmetry: Mira begins by running, ends by walking","Key choice: do not anthropomorphize the system, but allow a single rupture— “Good girl” —to fracture the neutrality and echo behavioral conditioning","Role: Final integrator and voice harmonizer (user), editorial sentinel and pattern recognizer (assistant)","Dialogue stripped of redundancy to tighten character voice and sharpen emotional velocity","Assistant flagged tonal soft spots; user executed surgical line edits for clarity and impact","Callum’s rhetoric trimmed to balance philosophy with fatigue; Mira’s responses tuned to reflect mounting cognitive load","Subtle worldbuilding strengthened via user-added textures (solar rigging, civic mantras, passive friction)","System messages rebalanced for affective minimalism— a bureaucracy that never blinks, until it does","Final readthrough verified thematic cohesion, symmetry, and tonal silence","Protocol stable.

A whisper spends 10, a sigh 20, and a single shouted word – ”why?” “how?” “please!” — can waste up to 110 decibels all by itself.","I’m frugal with my sounds. Saar and I were finally approved for a house in Neighborhood A7b six months ago and, even though I’ve only heard her hoarse alto whisper my name a few times since we moved in, the clean air, real trees, fences, fresh fruit, multiple bedrooms, and, of course, the quiet make it all worth it. The various quiets are both the best and worst parts of living in Neighborhood A7b. The quiet of others, the subtle noises of a peaceful planet finally returning to my ears after years in the churn and anger of the city, is a wonder. The quiet of myself, my caution in my own home, and the void in me that Saar’s voice once filled in the dwindling hours is hard, and it grows harder. But it’s worth it.","Society lost the war on light pollution. Stars hide behind a thick muslin of refracted fluorescence. Noise pollution, though, can still be fought, and after the recent Three-Month Riots, more and more areas like Neighborhood A7b provide just that. Peace and quiet. Quiet and peace.","Saar wakes up late, integrating the vibrations from her silent alarm into whatever strange worlds she travels through in her dreams. I am downstairs, still stewing on last night’s fight. Our words had spilled from our phone screens and notepaper chicken scratch into the air, and by the end of the fight we’d used almost all of our weekly noise allowance. Noises spent during “sleeping hours” are doubled, so last night was especially expensive.","She’s being reckless and unreasonable; I’m being cowardly and inflexible. It’s another iteration of the same fight we have over and over again. She came home late with a black eye, and was sweaty, haggard, and oh so happy.","She visited the soundproof bar in the basement of Madame Luxury’s Cosmetic and Costuming, an illicit, noisy place, Saar insists is unpatrolled by the noise drones. I don’t get it. Risking eviction, or worse, for a chance to listen to clanging punk music and screaming strangers seems like an utter failure of risk analysis. I love her. I think this life we have is enough. It’s safe. It’s clean. It’s peaceful, except for nights like last’s. We are happy. Right? I hate this gaping feeling her soiries left me with. Wasn’t this all enough for her?","I hardboil our eggs in the silent cooker while she sleeps. I intentionally cut the carton I finish into little pieces so Saar can’t use it as a cover to the basement next time she wants to sneak out and risk everything.","Saar comes downstairs with her shiner. It’s gotten worse since last night. The worst part of it all is that I can see in her a very real, embodied relaxation. Despite the fight that I’d spent the morning stewing over, despite the danger, despite the physical damage, she was happy.","I don’t want to fight, I write out on a sheet of paper I slide to her.","Then don’t , she answers. It’s nbd, she adds quickly as she slides the paper back to me.","It’s a VBFD to me , I write.","It’s all I have! she writes, grunting a little as she hands it to me. I wince as I watch another tick fall from our noise allotment tracker, then wince again as the meaning of the words hits me.","I tear up the paper, which somehow takes yet more of our allowance, and feel a white, angry heat begin to boil inside me. My watch vibrates, telling me the eggs are done, and breaks me from Saar’s defiant gaze.","You have me, I write, pressing the pen into a torn sheet of paper so hard that it tears even more.","Saar looks hurt, her eyes down at her bruised knuckles. She writes something on a note and scrawls it out. She wants to say something, but we’re almost out of noise. She shakes her head and goes back to the bedroom. I eat my egg over a small bed of kimchi and bring her a bowl, trying to walk the tightrope between apologizing and holding my ground.","She’s got her head in a pillow and her breathing is hitched. I run to her and try to pull the pillow away. Tears run down her face.","Are you concussed? I hold my phone out for her to see.","She laughs, through the tears, and I watch our noise allowance fall farther yet.","I scowl, despite her tears, or to spite them, maybe. She shows me her phone. Her brother is dead. I’ve never met him. He lives—lived—on the other side of the country, and even though they weren’t close, he was family. I hold her, even as I watch the rest of our noise allowance slowly drip to nothing with each heaved sob.","When she’s back asleep, I put in a bereavement increase request, and am auto approved as the AI agent scans the obituary and news articles I’d attached to the submission. The increase is limited to the household itself, and is, of course, non-transferable.","Two days of quadruple-noise-rations, and they go by so quickly I hardly notice them. We talk, finally talk, in quiet whispers dampened beneath the sheets. Her brother and her sang in the choir together, and I burn with shame realizing I didn’t know she sang. She cries, too, plenty. Loss sits on all of us differently.","“Do you know what my favorite game to play with my brother was?” she asks me one night beneath the sheets.","“Like the game where you drive cars toward each other until one of you panics and swerves?”","“No, no. It was this game we came up with, kind of, where whenever we were in a big public place that was mind-numbingly boring, we’d each take turns making a chicken noise. A squawk, a bock, you know. Only catch was, each noise had to be louder than the last. If you couldn’t: you’re the chicken. I remember one time, we were in some doctor's office, and they’d been making us wait for like an hour past our appointment time and so we started playing. I started with this tiny whisper of a chicken. Without even letting me finish, he stands up on his chair and in the loudest voice I have ever heard, does a full cocadoodle-doo, and to this day, I think it’s the hardest I’ve ever laughed.”","I realize how much I’ve missed her voice. So much of her brain becomes instantly legible to me through her speaking, while it’s usually opaque and distressing trying to decipher in text. I have always thought best through the written word. The intentionality, its measured process reflect the slow iterations of my internal language. She, though, sparkles in the spoken word. Language shoots like tiny sparks from her tongue and I see her, really see her, when I can hear her.","We make jokes and can laugh at them, too. When you make space for tears, it turns out you’re also making space for joy. When our increase ends, I feel better than I have in months, but I am ready to return to our routines. The quiet comes back to me like an old friend or a well-worn leather shoe.","Saar is restless, though. She fidgets. She’s sleeping less and less every night. I often wake and find her face illuminated with a weak blue, staring. dead-eyed, at some silent video of protestors or horror film where people’s tongues are burned out.","By the weekend, she tells me she’s going to go to Madame Luxury’s again. Tonight. I beg her not to. I use my words, convinced this will help her see reason.","“It’s this or fucking moving,” she finally snaps, and then leaves, slamming the door as a chunk of our regular allotment goes with her.","Neighborhood A7b is a gated community, but the gate works in both directions. Allowing interlopers into designated quiet zones is, obviously, a non-starter, but the demand for these holistically low-pollution neighborhoods is so high that leaving is a non-starter, too. They—we—are building a better, more peaceful world. Doing so requires commitment. Skin in the game. Buy-in helps prevent aural-degradation.","I am home alone, marinating in my annoyance with Saar, when the Riot alarms flash. Bright, searing white and red lights flash silently throughout the house and the neighbors’ and the streetlights and everywhere. We’re supposed to close the windows and enter lockdown protocol, but Saar isn’t home yet. She’s at Madame Luxury’s. If riots have somehow crashed into this neighborhood, then they must have been large and bad enough to have made it through the more heavily police surrounding neighborhoods and societal bulwarks that shield Neighborhood A7b.","Saar isn’t safe. Either the riots themselves or the response to them would get to her. The thought of losing her erases all the annoyance that I’d let marinate and fester and rot.","I leave the house, even though I shouldn’t, and jog, as light-footed as I can, toward Madame Luxury’s.","I hear Saar before I see her. An ancient, more-rust-than-paint, pickup truck coughs down the main street of town in the crepuscular light. In the bed of the truck an amplifier and speaker system blare. Loud, miserable cries screech through the dusk. Saar half-sings-half-screams into the microphone. She wails. She shouts. She holds one hand high in the air, defiantly, while the other holds a microphone, and she shreds her throat to ribbons.","A pain dehisces my chest open like a wound. There’s such agony in her voice. Who had I been kidding, pretending three days of whispering and inside jokes could have soothed her pain. I burned with shame, too, because I hadn’t noticed. I’d been too annoyed, too scared, too focused on my own concerns to see the fire raging inside her. Left without an outlet, she’d driven herself to this. A reckless, stupid act that wouldn’t change anything. A driver, a woman who I’d seen on walks, but never met, smiles from the front seat.","Saar’s voice cracks, but that hardly stops her. The more torn and hoarse she grows, the louder she screams. She screams until the riot police come. She screams even as they mount their noise suppression cannons and send inverse soundwaves into the air that quiet the night in an instant. I am pushed back, along with a couple other busy-body neighbors, when they apprehend Saar and her accomplice. They put her in the back of a van and disappear into the night.","A stone-faced detective leads a thorough search of our computers, trash, notebooks, mattress, pillowcases, bookshelves, and even toilets, later. I’m let off with a warning, and told to check my mail regularly for news about the enforced divorce procedures that the HOA would be going through to get me separated from this bad actor . Shame, once a kindled torch, was now a forest fire. I deny all knowledge of her illicit activities. They ask if I knew anything about her illegal activities. If she’d been acting strange. I lie and throw her under the bus and feel so guilty I consider breaking every mirror in my house when the detective finally leaves.","I keep one secret for her, a final acquiescence to an argument that seems so stupid now in retrospect. I don’t tell them about Madame Luxury’s. I don’t know why. I’ll probably never see Saar again, unless I, too, lose my mind.","A year and two very quiet months later, I cannot sleep. I miss Saar more each day and nothing I do seems to help. The meditation practices I get from my therapist do not help, or calm me. The oils and medications and transcranial magnetic stimulation designed to help treatment resistant depression do nothing but give me two months of migraines.","I don’t know what compels me, but I leave the house after fishing an egg carton from the recycling bin. I walk two miles to Madame Luxury’s. I walk around the back to the cellar entrance and knock four times, pause, then knock seven more. The door slides open, I hand a tall man my egg carton and he lets me inside.","It’s a dank room that smells simultaneously of mold and some kind of rubbing or drinking alcohol. It’s tight packed, and there are many faces I would never have expected to see in a place like this: my elderly neighbor Carole and her husband Greg; the stodgy single mother with a permanent frown from across the street; even the tight-lipped librarian are all mulling about and talking freely. There are smiles, though I note that I’m not the only one nervous about being here.","The lights dim for a minute as a few people climb onto the makeshift stage at the front of the room. An amplifier turns on. painful, shrill note crackles from a guitar. The drum comes in behind him. The walls, lined with row after row of egg cartons meant to dampen the sound, shake, and the whole room begins to bounce.","It takes a minute for me to make any noise. I am not used to it. I have been silent, almost entirely, since Saar left, and I am out of practice making an impact in the world.","I turn my head to the ceiling and surrounded by a complete cacophony I let all the pain inside me loose. I scream. I shout. I hurtle every expletive I know into the din. I scream Saar’s name. I shout every apology I ever kept buried beneath my pride and ego, even though it’s far too late. I scream, and I don’t feel better, but I feel more. The music thrums. I am free. The guitar wails. Saar is gone. I miss her so much. I scream. No one stops me.

Plus – a meetup in San Francisco on May 25, two Edge Esmeralda tickets up for grabs, the penultimate SoP25 spotlight, and the weekly hard tech horizon.","The hum of the bio-regeneration unit was a constant, low thrum in Unit 7, a sound that usually lulled patients into a more peaceful twilight. Dr. Anya Sharma adjusted her augmented reality lenses, the data overlays flickering across her vision, a cascade of numbers and waveforms dancing across the periphery of her sight. It was 2093, and while the gleaming towers of Neo-Kyoto pierced the clouds and personal space travel was as common as taking a bus, the human experience of mortality remained stubbornly, illusively, the same.","Anya worked at the Serenity Now Hospice, a facility nestled amidst a meticulously curated bio-dome, a verdant oasis amidst the sprawling urban landscape. It wasn't just about making people comfortable as they slipped away. It was about ensuring a dignified, personalized transition, guided by intricate protocols developed over decades of technological and medical advancement, a delicate dance between cold science and warm compassion.","Today, her patient was Elias Vance, 87, a retired astro-engineer with a twinkle in his eyes and a rapidly failing neural network. His personalized care chip, embedded at the base of his skull, pulsed with a soft, amber light, indicating a critical decline. The chip, a marvel of miniaturized technology, was a constant monitor, relaying vital signs and neural activity in real-time, allowing for precise adjustments to his care.","\"Morning, Elias,\" Anya said, her voice warm, as she approached his bedside. The room was bathed in the soft, diffused light of the bio-dome, filtered through the foliage of genetically modified, bioluminescent plants. \"How are we feeling today?\"","Elias's lips quirked into a faint smile, a network of fine lines crinkling around his eyes. \"Like I'm floating in a nebula, Doc. A bit hazy, but not unpleasant. Glad to see I’m still here”. He raised a hand, the skin thin and translucent, to gesture weakly around the room. \"Though, I must say, the view is a bit… terrestrial for an old stargazer.\"","Anya chuckled, a soft, melodic sound. \"That's good to hear. The morphine drip is doing its job. Let's check your vitals. We can always make some adjustments to the VR landscape later.”","She activated the integrated diagnostic scanner on her wristband, a sleek, silver band that hummed with quiet efficiency. The results instantly appeared on her lens display, a tapestry of data overlaid on her vision casting a slight glow upon her cheeks. Elias's neural activity was fluctuating, his cardiac output was weakening, and his cellular regeneration was effectively non-existent. \"Protocol 7.4.2,\" she murmured, referencing the hospice's internal guidelines, a complex web of algorithms and medical procedures. \"Initiate the neural smoothing sequence and adjust the pain management algorithm.\"","The neural smoothing sequence was a gentle cascade of targeted electrical pulses, delivered directly to the brain via the care chip, designed to minimize any agitation or distress as the brain's functions began to shut down. The pain management algorithm, constantly adapting to Elias's physiological feedback, adjusted the morphine dosage to maintain optimal comfort without hastening his departure, a delicate balancing act.","\"You know, Doc,\" Elias said, his voice a whisper, \"I've seen some incredible things in my life. I've watched humanity reach beyond Earth, touch the stars. I've seen the rings of Saturn from a personal shuttle, the aurora borealis from the moon's surface. But this…\" He gestured weakly around the room, his gaze lingering on the bioluminescent plants.","Anya nodded, her heart aching slightly. She'd been doing this for fifteen years, and the emotional toll never truly lessened. Each patient was a universe unto themselves, a constellation of memories and experiences and in a way she had to relive it with each one of them.","\"It is, Elias. And we're here to make sure it's as peaceful as possible.\" She checked the bio-regeneration unit's output, a sleek, white pod that enveloped the bed. It was maintaining a stable temperature and humidity, ensuring Elias's skin remained comfortable and hydrated. The unit also emitted a low-frequency hum, a subtle vibration designed to soothe the autonomic nervous system, a gentle caress for the body. \"How's the VR simulation?\" she asked, glancing at the holographic projector above his bed, a shimmering orb that cast a soft, ethereal light.","Elias was immersed in a personalized virtual reality environment, a recreation of his favorite childhood beach on the now submerged Maldives. The program was designed to evoke positive memories and provide a sense of familiarity and comfort, a digital sanctuary. \"The waves sound real,\" he breathed, his eyes closed, a faint smile playing on his lips. \"I can almost feel the sand between my toes. The salt air… it brings me back.\"","\"Good,\" Anya said. \"That's what we want.\"","She checked his Advanced Directive, a digital document outlining his wishes for end-of-life care, a testament to his autonomy. Elias had opted for a \"soft landing,\" meaning minimal intervention beyond pain management and comfort measures. He had also requested a \"neural echo,\" a process that captured a snapshot of his neural activity just before death, allowing for a limited form of digital preservation, a digital ghost. \"Protocol 8.1.1,\" she reminded herself, \"Prepare for neural echo capture within the next 12 hours.\"","The neural echo was a controversial technology, raising ethical questions about the nature of consciousness and the boundaries of life and death. But for many, it offered a sense of continuity, a way to leave a digital legacy for loved ones, a flickering echo in the vast digital expanse.","Anya spent the next few hours monitoring Elias, adjusting his medication, and ensuring his comfort. She chatted with him about his life, his travels, his family, his first trip to mars. She listened to his stories, his regrets, his hopes, the tapestry of a life well lived. It was a delicate dance, balancing medical protocols with human connection, a combination of science and empathy.","Around midnight, Elias's breathing became shallow and irregular, a faint rattle in his chest. His neural activity spiked, then began to decline rapidly, the waveforms on her lens display flattening. \"It's time,\" Anya said softly, activating the neural echo capture sequence.","The room was bathed in a soft, blue light as the scanner pulsed, a gentle hum resonating through the air, capturing the final moments of Elias's neural activity, the last vestiges of his consciousness, then he was gone. His heart had stopped beating, a silent cessation. Anya deactivated the bio-regeneration unit and closed Elias's eyes, a gesture of finality. She then initiated the \"transition protocol,\" a series of automated procedures that prepared the body for its final journey, a respectful farewell prior to his being moved to the crematorium.","She felt a familiar sense of sadness, a pang of loss, but also a sense of peace, a quiet satisfaction. She had done her job, ensuring Elias's transition was as comfortable and dignified as possible, a gentle passage. She remembered hearing accounts of unassisted death in her youth and felt comfort knowing her work was making a difference for people.","Later that afternoon, Anya sat in the staff lounge, a quiet space with panoramic views of the bio-dome, sipping a cup of chamomile tea. The lounge was quiet, the only sound the gentle hum of the building's ventilation system, a soft, white noise. \"Another one gone,\" said Nurse Kai, a veteran of the hospice, his face etched with the lines of countless goodbyes.","Anya nodded. \"Elias Vance. He was a good man. He told me about his first trip to the outer planets. A real pioneer. One of the earliest of the post Musk era astronauts.”","\"For the most part, they all are,\" Kai said. \"That's the thing about this job. You see the best and worst of humanity, all in the same breath. The bravery, the fear, the love… it’s all here.\"","Anya smiled, a faint, weary smile. \"I’ve been trying to learn to appreciate the small moments, the quiet victories. A peaceful death is a victory in itself, a final act of grace.\"","\"It is,\" Kai agreed. \"It is.” They sat in silence for a moment, each lost in their own thoughts. Anya thought about the neural echo, the digital snapshot of Elias's consciousness, a ghost in the machine. She wondered what it would be like to exist as a digital echo, a whisper of a life lived. \"You ever think about your own end?\" Kai asked, breaking the silence, his voice low.","Anya shrugged, a subtle movement of her shoulders. \"Sometimes. But I try not to dwell on it. We all have our own paths to follow, unknown journeys to take. I’ll delve into dealing with my demise later.\" Anya finished her tea and stood up, the chair scraping softly against the floor. \"I'm going to check on Mrs. Peterson in Unit 3.” As Anya walked past the large plate window that overlooked the biodome she saw a sudden flash of a shadow on the glass. Startled, she looked up just as a sparrow being chased by a small hawk, its talons extended, smashed into it.","In each new issue of Protocolized, leading up to Protocol Worlds at Edge Esmeralda, we’ll introduce one of this year’s teaching fellows.","Eric Alston is a Scholar in Residence in the Finance Division and the Faculty Director of the Hernando de Soto Capital Markets Program at the University of Colorado Boulder.

The technique involves spraying fine sea salt aerosols into marine clouds, increasing their reflectivity and reducing the solar energy that reaches Earth’s surface. Early experiments indicate this method could temporarily lower temperatures and buy crucial time for societies to address underlying carbon emissions, particularly around climate-sensitive regions like coral reefs or polar ice sheets.","Despite its promise, MCB raises challenging questions about governance, unintended consequences, and equity. Protocols must be developed for international coordination – such as how decisions about deployment are made, who bears liability for unintended regional impacts, and how transparency and public oversight are maintained. Without clear protocols, the risk of diplomatic tensions or ecological backlash could overshadow potential benefits.","For science fiction storytellers, marine cloud brightening offers intriguing scenarios beyond the standard geoengineering cautionary tales. Consider narratives exploring communities deliberately engineering microclimates to protect local agriculture or cultures reshaped around weather design as a civic practice. Instead of global catastrophes, stories might examine subtler tensions—such as coastal towns negotiating regional cloud brightening rights, or cultural shifts arising from communities accustomed to shaping their own weather patterns, prompting reflections on human agency, climate responsibility, and collective decision-making.","Nils Gilman recently explored marine cloud brightening and some other solar radiation modification (SRM) technologies in this piece:"],"tags":[]},{"id":95,"title":"A Very Short Introduction to Memory and Technology","subtitle":"Issue #44: From the Memory Research Group","author":"Unknown","content":["This is the first post in a monthly Memory Research Group series. The Memory Research Group is a Special Interest Group (SIG) incubated by Summer of Protocols. We meet online every two weeks on Discord to discuss a text related to *memory,* a concept that has varied manifestations across disciplines.","The term memorization has seen better days.","It calls to mind glossary lists, standardized tests, and flash card games. Superficial memorization has come to signify the opposite of what it means to deeply know something.","This stands in contrast to what memory has meant in other historical periods, and what it might mean again as tools come to more dynamically mould our memories. The question isn’t whether machines should take over memorization, but how we understand the concept of memory itself.","In our first Memory Research Group meeting, we read the opening of Frances Yates’ classic work The Art of Memory , which begins with the central folk tale of the Hellenic art of memory.","The poet Simonides attended a banquet where he was called outside just before the roof collapsed. When asked to identify the guests under the rubble, Simonides realized he could recall exactly where each person had been seated. This disaster revealed a method: by associating information with specific locations in space, memory could be reliably protocolized. This became a foundational technique known as the method of loci .","Yates describes how Cicero helped popularize this story in De Oratore , his 55 BCE treatise that introduced five canons of rhetoric: Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery. Interestingly, we noted, memory doesn’t yet seem to occupy the role we’re familiar with, the memorization of facts. Instead, in this excerpt, Invention mostly described this capacity.","Cicero described Memory as something at once more dynamic and more intimate than Invention. It referred to the faculty that enables “firm perception of things,” transforming scattered knowledge into living understanding. As I’ve written about in other posts , certain 15th century branches of the art of memory embraced this meaning, evolving into elaborate systems for organizing not just facts, but ways of thinking.","Memory, in this sense, didn’t oppose human knowing. Even the rote memorization behind the remembrance of scriptures could be a foundation for deeper contemplative practice. What makes this different today?","We’ve never lived without feedback loops in our environment. The human who uses an axe every day impresses their grip on its wooden handle over time. In ecology, shifting parts comprise a whole system in constant flux. Do we question what thoughts the axe took from us, or what thoughts dim when we rely on the universe as a memory system?","In the 1960s, anthropologist Gregory Bateson wrote that a man, a tree, and an axe form an information system. Humans have long looked to ‘the universe’ as a memory system capable of supporting human knowing. In literal as well as more subtle ways, cosmology operated as a technology for organizing knowledge.","Yet a recent study demonstrated diminished brain activity among users of ChatGPT, sparking debates about cognitive dependency.","What makes this moment different is that while in the 20th century, many people got access to tools, in the 21st century, tools got access to us. Like the living world, these tools can now anticipate our actions through feedback loops. These tools develop models of who we are, and – even more ghastly – they act on them. They predict and suggest our desires, curate our environments, and shape our decision-making processes.","The axe, in contrast, allowed us to directly witness the beginning and end of our own agency, or so we think. Its feedback loop is apparently immediate, until we consider the contingency of the materials that produced the axe, the tree that it fells, and so on.","Still, AI tools are decidedly less discrete than the axe. These tools incorporate direct feedback loops with the profusion of things that brought them into existence: private corporations and public research, capital and natural resources. To these systems we are a data point in a statistical distribution, so we categorically can't establish a convivial, human trust in them without these conditions changing. 1","If AI tools uniquely threaten to diminish thinking itself, how could they possibly benefit us?","Philosopher Bernard Stiegler distinguishes technology in its broadest sense as what makes us human, and he considers technical memory as that which “enables the transmission of the individual experience of people from generation to generation.” As he says, “When a prehistoric man cuts flint ... obviously he doesn't cut flint to preserve his memory. But the act of cutting preserves ... his gestures on the flint, and in fact, constitutes a new memory support.” 2 Producing technology produces memory.","Of course, the suggestion that technology acts as an extension of our faculties has been well-theorized. Marshall McLuhan proposed that technologies can act as extensions but also amputations of our faculties. The wheel extends our feet but potentially atrophies our walking. Writing extends our memory but potentially weakens our capacity for oral recitation.","Less frequently asked questions follow: what technologies might be prosthetics for faculties that other technologies have amputated? In other words, some technologies may have diminished our senses so long ago that we now build new technologies to restore them, unaware that at one time they may have been ‘part’ of us.","While remaining highly conceptual, this thought experiment suggests a different way of approaching AI tools. Due to gaps in memory from generation to generation, it’s possible that we build technology to recover senses that we systematically diminished over time.","How do we even remember what might be ‘natural’ for us in the first place – these phantom memories?","The next question in this thought experiment could be: when these new tools amputate our faculties, do they now possess them? While our tools might not have us in memory like the “firm perception” elaborated by Cicero, it sometimes uncannily seems like they do. They model our behavioral patterns in ways that can feel more comprehensive than our own self-knowledge.","To have something in memory most closely mirrors our understanding of the evolution of matter: memory is something that can be passed on. In more abstract terms, memory is the ability of matter to assert that things, as they are now, are not how they were previously.","In this sense, memory isn’t threatened by machines. It has always worked in concert with the environment, and it will continue learning novel ways of doing so, now with billions more connections available. Human memory deepens the more we can ask the environment around us: ‘What am I not considering in this context?’ and have the environment respond knowingly, with some uncertainty but also with some aid.","This historical perspective suggests that current discourse, divided between relegating human memorization to machines or refusing machines as threats to human knowing, might be missing something crucial about the role of memory: memory has never been fully internal or external to us. It exists between us, and it can have merit as a practice on its own terms.","Memory can be understood again as the “firm perception of things,” that which provides wider and deeper context to scattered knowledge, and that which exists as an inevitable creation of technology itself.","This post is representative of the thought threads we weave as part of the Memory Research Group, as well as the under-edited, idle wonderings that occur through working on my upcoming book Artificial Memory .","In our Memory Research Group sessions to date, we’ve read an excerpt from Cognition in the Wild by Edwin Hutchins, an influential ethnography of naval ship navigation turned discourse on the state of cognitive science in the 1990s. We’ve also explored studies by Michael Levin related to non-neural substrates for memory.","We're currently diving into some foundational work in neuroscience, reading The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map and other studies on the role of the hippocampus in human memory, to give greater context to contemporary work by the Levin Lab and others researchers like Nikolay Kukushkin.","While we’re more focused on the sciences right now, the Memory Research Group will detour through many other fields as it continues, surveying the work of Mary Carruthers, Henri Bergson, and others. You can participate through attending our sessions every two weeks and by sending us pitches for Protocolized posts on these topics in the Summer of Protocols Discord.","So if you'd like to join, escape the need to remember the next session on your own, and add it to your calendar by clicking on the Memory Research Group event.","The next Memory Research Group session is August 21, 2025 at 1430 UTC on Discord .","For more on understanding how these tools sense us, I’d suggest the talk by K Allado-McDowell, ‘ On Neural Media ,’ Long Now Foundation, March 8, 2025.","Ryan Bishop and Daniel Ross, ‘ Technics, Time and the Internation: Bernard Stiegler’s Thought – A Dialogue with Daniel Ross ,’ Theory, Culture & Society 38, no. 4 (July 2021): 111–33."],"tags":["Liked by Protocolized"]},{"id":96,"title":"Dirt Simple","subtitle":"Issue #17: Shovels & AI memos, hardened commons, and Discord highlights","author":"Unknown","content":["In this issue: A case study at the Crescenta Valley Water District that examines the problems – and opportunities – of the public sector’s invisible mazes of protocols.

It fails because too many people are stuck trying to decode an invisible maze of protocols, half-remembered workarounds, and institutional memory trapped in someone’s Outlook archive.","That’s why we at the California Adaptive Technology (CAT) Initiative are telling the story of a quiet but powerful shift at Crescenta Valley Water District (CVWD). This article contains two case studies of how front-line workers can use protocols – often perceived as top-down, bureaucratic excess – to help a government to do what it’s supposed to do: deliver.","This isn’t about a moonshot. It’s about a ditch, a spreadsheet and an AI-generated memorandum. Let’s dive in.","Nearly ten years. That’s how long it took to build a stormwater recharge ditch in my hometown north of L.A. Not a dam. Not a desalination plant. Just a basic diversion channel – a design older than modern civilization itself. The kind of thing you could (and we did!) dig in a single day.","Why do we need stormwater ditches? They recharge groundwater, save money, and help maintain the environment. Everyone agreed to dig – except the permitting gods, who require you to consult an oracle, get a permit, maybe loop in the Army Corps, and definitely chase down a property rights signoff – that may or may not exist. Kafka would be proud.","So what did we do? We flowed like water.","First of all, we went straight to the site with a shovel in hand. Talked to people on the ground. When the permitting maze got too thick, we looked for workarounds (what we like to call scenic routes). Instead of taking the most direct path of permit acquisition, we partnered with a local NGO that owned the Rosemont Preserve parcel) and used their existing permit as a legal hack. That mutually beneficial workaround was hardened in a memorandum of understanding – drafted by AI. Bureaucratic aikido.","As above, so below – we now had to find an underground workaround. CVWD’s service area isn’t called Rockcrescenta for nothing. Big boulders are just part of the deal.","But here’s where taking matters into your own hands makes a difference: when you do projects in-house, you are more adaptable. You can handle surprises – like a refrigerator-sized rock – without triggering a $200,000 contractor change order. Let’s be real: if you give some folks an excuse to nickel-and-dime you, they will.","This was a major learning from the project: keep projects in-house where you can flex. Being able to manage uncertainty and learn on the way is an organizational competency. And on average, it’s cheaper, faster, and more resilient.","A quick aside before another case study Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) project and future frontiers, let’s talk about one of the most underutilized tools in the public sector: project retrospectives.","After a scramble over a grant deadline nearly derailed a big AMI (An AMI streams real time water usage data) project, CVWD didn’t just breathe a sigh of relief and move on. The team paused. They asked: What happened? What assumptions broke? Where did we trip?","That reflective pattern of behavior is a protocol.We do short, scheduled after-action reviews for every major milestone. No finger-pointing. Just learning. And that learning loop becomes a central feature ofan adaptive organization.","CVWD’s AMI project is a case study in how bureaucratic stalemates can sabotage good policy – and how dirt-simple protocols can fix it.","The District spent millions of dollars installing AMI meters.","The meters were physically in the ground.","But the radios that made them “smart”? Not installed.","Why? A tangle of turf battles, budget shortfalls, and a byzantine process involving a dozen spreadsheets , mismatched schedules, and unclear ownership.","For over a decade, less than 0.2% of customers could actually access their water data. That’s not underperformance. That’s institutional irony.Then came the protocol shift:","It synced automatically between field and office teams.","It replaced email scavenger hunts with shared visibility.","It turned data chaos into coordinated delivery.","Not a dashboard. Not a portal. Just an all hands email to CVWD’s 32 staff people. One place, one update, one operational picture. Suddenly, everyone – from finance to field crews – had visibility. Gaps surfaced andaction followed naturally.","The result of that work? Today 93%+ of customers can access their water data. The project is on track for completion this fiscal year . Same people. Same meters. Just better protocols.","Bureaucratic systems love to optimize processes. But what they often forget is that trust is a kind of infrastructure in its own right.","One of the lesser-known but most transformative protocols CVWD implemented wasn’t digital or operational – it was relational. Internally known as the Discovery Protocol, it wasn’t built in Airtable or coded into a permit script. It was built into long lunches, meandering walks, and unhurried conversation.","Staff were encouraged – formally – to take extended 90-minute lunch breaks. Not to “catch up on work” or “power through,” but to go outside, eat together, and walk through Descanso Gardens. Phones stayed in pockets. Formal titles stayed at the office. And what emerged was something rarely achieved in government org charts: real human connection.","These walks became crucibles of change. Engineers talked with planners. Field staff swapped stories with finance folks. Problems that had been stuck for months began to dissolve – not through memos, but through shared meals and real empathy. Instead of \"that’s not my department,\" people began to ask, how can I help?","This wasn’t just about feel-good team bonding. The Discovery Protocol functioned as a meta-protocol – a cultural operating system that allowed all the other protocols (AMI reform, field data ops, adaptive ditch-building) to actually work. Because people had built trust, they could move faster. Take risks. Ask questions. Own problems together.","It was part of a broader cultural effort at CVWD to open hearts and minds, recognizing that adaptive infrastructure is not just a technical problem. It’s a human one. And no spreadsheet, no dashboard, no AI model can replace what two people can do over lunch when they actually listen to each other.","The lesson? You don’t rebuild systems without rebuilding the relationships inside them. The Discovery Protocol did just that.","If adaptive infrastructure is about using what you already have in smarter ways, the next frontier of operational improvement is hiding in plain sight: piggybacking sensor networks onto routine field operations.","Install low-cost imagery sensors on district vehicles – meter readers, fire flow testers, water quality samplers.","As they drive their routes, they collect street imagery.","That imagery feeds into a lightweight pipeline to monitor street quality across the district.","You’ve just turned routine workflows into a living map of civic infrastructure.","This isn’t sci-fi. It’s a simple protocol shift: embed sensing into existing work, then route that data into usable, visual insights. Call it embedded observation . Call it ambient infrastructure intelligence . Whatever you call it, it’s efficient, imaginative, and stunningly actionable.","Begin by asking: “Where can we go with what we have?”","There’s a persistent challenge with government operations.","The implicit, unspoken protocols for how things are “supposed” to get done? They’re not just murky. They’re mythological. There's folklore around processes and policies. Everyone “knows” someone you need to talk to. Everyone has their own spreadsheet, contact list and folder of templates. And the real bottleneck? It’s usually figuring out who actually has the power to say yes.","This isn’t just annoying. It can be operationally paralyzing.","As pointed out by Nadia Asparouhova in her Summer of Protocols research, this is a textbook case of implicit, informal, and inconsistent Kafka Protocols – the worst kind. Even when protocols aren’t written down, people rely on oral tradition. And government becomes a whisper network of “that’s just how we do things.”","Folkloric workflows (“Talk to Janice in Engineering, she knows a guy...”)","Paper files in digital worlds (and vice versa)","Policies that conflict with practices that conflict with what the law actually says","We’re not saying we need 500-page manuals. We’re saying we need clarity. We need protocols that are legible and grounded in reality – not vibes or piles of paperwork.","Too often California government operational records are half digital, half scrolls-in-a-filing-cabinet. That hybrid reality creates protocol drift. You don’t know what’s binding, because you don’t know if it’s in a Word doc, a state law, or Barbara’s head (Barbara retired in 2018).","Take the stormwater ditch: we didn’t even know what permit was truly required. That’s not a compliance issue – it’s an information architecture failure. And it’s why we believe AI can help. Drafting MOUs, summarizing legal frameworks, translating “govspeak” into actionable steps – that’s what the next-gen protocol engine looks like.","Start with Visibility: You can’t fix what you can’t see. Make workflows legible. Use tools like shared spreadsheets, dashboards, or even a routine structured email.","Build from the actual Workflow: If your protocol doesn’t map to how real people do real work, it’s not a protocol – it’s a fantasy.","Streamline Ruthlessly: Focus on the flow. Remove the friction. Question the parts that exist just because “that’s how we’ve always done it.” Treat Project Retrospectives as Civic Ritual: Don't move on until you've looked back. Every stumble contains the seeds of future resilience, but they need to be attended to. Use AI as a Protocol Partner: Don’t wait for a moonshot. Start with small wins. Draft documents, summarize email threads, generate checklists. Use the tech to amplify your staff’s judgment. Design for the Street Level: Protocols shouldn’t live in binders. They should live in trucks, phones, and calendars. Embed them where the real work happens.","Treat Protocols as Civic Infrastructure: They’re not just internal. Good protocols create clarity, transparency, and trust for everyone – from staff to ratepayers."],"tags":[]}]
